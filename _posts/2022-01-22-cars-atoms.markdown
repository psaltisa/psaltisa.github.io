### How it all started

Last year, due to the ongoing pandemic, I was thinking of picking up a hobby - preferably an outdoorsy one - to keep me active during the winter.
Running was the obvious choice, since I've been practicing consistently for many years with an exception of a 2-year-slump during my Ph.D., but I also wanted something to keep my mind sharp and strengthen my visual skills and pattern recognition. One day during the Christmas holidays, I was on a
walk with a good friend of mine (also a nuclear physicist) that has been in Darmstadt for many years and he pointed towards a parked car's number
plate saying: "Hey, this is chlorine!"

### The anatomy of a German number plate

Vehicle number plates in Germany have a very distinct pattern, which allows to get letter combinations that correspond to elements in the periodic table. Below you can see the components of a typical number plate.

        </div>

For example, the plate `DA FE 8970` would be a plate from Darmstadt (DA) where iron (Fe) is shown, and all plates from Frankfurt that start with an `F` show fluorine! My friend told me that some colleagues of his had found almost all elements in car plates within Darmstadt. I thought that this would be a fun project for the winter/spring, to find and take a picture of all 118 (until now) elements in the periodic table.

### The hunt is on!

The beginning of the *'gotta catch'em all'* with car plates was extremely easy, and with couple of long walks I was able to gather the first 30-40 pictures. As you might imagine, at some point, finding undiscovered elements/plates was quite cumbersome, with a discovery rate of around 1-2 per week. Finally, after three months, I was able to find my last missing element (zinc) and complete the periodic table! To be honest, I was keep looking at car plates for a long time after I finished this project - maybe I still do sometimes ü§≠.


### Making the collage

Before making the collage, I had to blur the rest of the plate to protect the privacy of the car owners. Then, I just had to decide how to make the collage. I ended up with a simple format, but I might come up with alternatives in the future for nuclear car 2.0.
