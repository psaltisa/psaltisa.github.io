- [A Four-Day Workweek Reduces Stress without Hurting Productivity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-four-day-workweek-reduces-stress-without-hurting-productivity/){:target="\_blank"} by Jan Dönges, Sophie Bushwick

  There is a very active movement that supports a four-day workweek and recent
  research, as discussed in this article, shows that it promotes both the
  productivity and the well-being of workers. A similar reading is the book
  [Shorter](https://www.strategy.rest/?page_id=8645) by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang. 
  
  > <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> The kinds of results that [the researchers are] reporting are more substantial than many of those [wellness] programs. Because again, a lot of what these programs are doing are helping people tolerate the situation that they’re in rather than changing [that situation]. It’s a much more profound thing to do—to change the nature of work—than it is to help people put up with what they’ve got.

- [Why the super rich are
  inevitable](https://pudding.cool/2022/12/yard-sale/){:target="\_blank"} by The Pudding

  A fun and interactive post with some simple capitalism math, based on the
  "Yard-sale model". I found very interesting the results of the simulations
  when redistribution was included in the system.

  > <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.

- [The Virtue of Owning Books You Haven’t Read: Why Umberto Eco Kept an
  “Antilibrary”](https://www.openculture.com/2022/11/the-virtue-of-owning-books-you-havent-read-why-umberto-eco-kept-an-antilibrary.html){:target="\_blank"}
  by Open Culture

  This is an article I found to justify my love for buying books at a higher
  rate than I read them. The video with Umberto Eco going through his personal
  library to find a book is amazing!
  
    > <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> The titles lining my own home remind
  me that I know little to nothing about cryptography, the evolution of
  feathers, Italian folklore, illicit drug use in the Third Reich, and
  whatever entomophagy is.
