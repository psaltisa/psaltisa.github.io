- [Communication Really Happens in the Carpool...](https://davidepstein.substack.com/p/communication-really-happens-in-the){:target="\_blank"} by David Epstein

  This article highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and spontaneous interactions in fostering innovation. With remote work, creating intentional opportunities for idea exchange is crucial. Examples include NASA's "Monday Notes" and proactive information sharing among hospital interns. Encouraging diverse reading and idea cross-pollination can also enhance creativity and innovation.

- [On The Degrading Effects of Life Online](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/degrading-effects-of-life-online){:target="\_blank"} by Jon Haidt
and Freya India

  An article about how social media makes us worse people. There is some discussion regarding efforts in the UK to limit children's smartphone use, highlighting initiatives by individuals like Daisy Greenwell and Clare Reynolds, and the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code. It examines the negative impact of social media on children's mental health and development, sharing disturbing testimonies from teens. Good read to understand the issue with social media use and young people.

- [Quantum dialectics](https://aeon.co/essays/how-soviet-communist-philosophy-shaped-postwar-quantum-theory?utm_source=rss-feed){:target="\_blank"}
  by Nigel Warburton

  This article discusses how Soviet Marxist philosophy influenced postwar quantum theory, particularly through the work of physicist David Bohm. It explores how Soviet ideology shaped scientific discourse and contributed to the development of Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics, which emphasized a deterministic universe in contrast to the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation.

    > <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> It was not enough just to interpret the world, Marx claimed. Philosophers must also seek to change it
