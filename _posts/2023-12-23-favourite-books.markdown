### [The Scarcity Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Scarcity-Brain-Craving-Mindset-Rewire/dp/0593236629) by Michael Easter


Michael Easter's dive into the intricacies of the human mind grappling with scarcity struck a chord with me. "The Scarcity Brain" is not just a book; it's a journey into the psychology of decision-making and resilience in the face of limitations. Easter's insights linger, urging us to ponder the profound ways scarcity influences our daily choices. I have also read his previous book, "The Comfort Crisis", which was really well written.
