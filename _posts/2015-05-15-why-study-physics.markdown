labs start tomorrow and I am feeling anxious because it will be my first time instructing students as a graduate student. PHYSICS 1A03 is an introductory physics 
course designed for students that may have not taken a physics course during High School.</p>
  

<p>All this pre-lab preparation made me think why I chose to study physics - pre-quarter-age crisis maybe? Since I can remember I was a very curious kid that 
was really fond of changing things in order to see what the outcome. From throwing a pebble to the sea to watch the ripples of the water - once I hit my dad, oops - to 
- a not so pleasant experience for my mom - throwing things on the floor and test if they break or not, I always wanted to find answers by thinking and experimenting. 
This curiosity pushed me to study physics and try to find out how universe works. However, physics can not guarantee that every prediction is absolutely true. It is your responsibility, 
as a scientist, to test these predictions - most of the times to its limits - and verify or - even better - refute an established theory. </p>

<p>Many think that physicists, and scientists in general, only care about the verification of a theory in detail.
If this statement were true, probably there were not laptops and internet, because J. C. Maxwell would have tried to verify an existing theory.
Physics, one way or another, will teach you how to see nature - moreover, the word Physics comes from the Greek word φύση=nature - in a different way.
You should always have in mind that you are also a part of the universe and you are made of the same material as everything you observe. For this reason, you have
to respect and love the universe.</p>

<blockquote>Physics can not guarantee that every prediction is absolutely true. It is your responsibility, as a scientist, to test these predictions -

<p>Studying physics is a great way to develop a new way of thinking, the scientific one. This kind of thinking can be described by four stages. First, you have to observe
and question everything. For example, why do objects fall when I throw them to the air? Then, you have to make a hypothesis. Newton assumed that objects fall due to a force
called <i>gravity</i> and created a mathematical model to <i>exlpain</i> this phenomenon and <i>predict</i> similar events. After that, you have to test your hypothesis. 
If it is true, then - hooray - this hypothesis is transformed into a law of nature, otherwise - no worries - you have to begin all over again with a new model. This is a very 
important part of scientific method. Failures should not be treated as obstacles, but as opportunities for further research - also &quot;silly&quot; questions are more than welcome! 
Scientific thinking is useful not only in one&#39;s academic career, but also for your life. A physicist is not, as many might think, a crazy technocrat that is indifferent
for the society and cares only for his whiteboard - well, sure there are some that behave like that, but I hope it is not the majority. As an aware and active citizen, a physicist 
has to observe the society and its institutions, and in case that something is detrimental he is obliged to stand up and speak, providing solutions and discuss with the other members 
of the society - so, don&#39;t you ever compromise, both in science and society.</p>

<p>The aim of PHYSICS 1A03 is to show students that physics is so AWESOME! I hope the students will get a good taste of how cool physics is.
Just let your mind free, and physics will guide you in the most incredible - but real - realms, from the tiny atom to the vast cosmos.</p>
