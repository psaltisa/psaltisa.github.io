In the vast and endless space,\
A wondrous tale we often trace.\
Of elements that form our race,\
And in the stars, they find their place.

Born in the heart of a star,\
Elements fused, a cosmic czar.\
In the furnace where they war,\
A mighty force, and then they soar.

Hydrogen and helium, the first two,\
In the star's womb, they renew.\
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen too,\
All formed in the stars' debut.

Supernovas explode, elements endowed,\
Scattered and bestowed, in the universe, they crowd.\
Iron, gold, and silver galore,\
All formed in the stars' core.

A tale of creation, a cosmic inspiration,\
Of the elements, for our admiration.\
In the stars, their formation,\
A wondrous cosmic revelation.

Oh, the mystery of the universe,\
Of the stars, an endless verse.\
Of elements, the essence of our birth,\
A cosmic tale, of infinite worth.
