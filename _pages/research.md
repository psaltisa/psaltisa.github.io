My research focuses on understanding the nuclear processes that occur
in stellar environments and their effect on the production of energy,
stellar lifetimes and the synthesis of the chemical elements.
In particular, I am interested in explosive environments, such as
core--collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, classical novae and
X--ray bursts.

I have adopted a twofold approach to my research program. On the one hand,
I study which are the most important nuclear physics ingredients
for the evolution of astrophysical environments via nucleosynthesis
calculations based on state-of-the art theoretical stellar modeling.

On the other hand, I study these important nuclear processes by
performing experiments using particle accelerators. These experiments
aim at reducing the uncertainties of the stellar models and improve our
current understanding of stellar environments, which can be examined
with observations by astronomers.

I am currently proposing and conducting experiments, in collaboration
with other researchers, at nuclear physics facilities around the world,
such as [TRIUMF](https://triumf.ca){:target="\_blank"} in Canada,
[RIKEN](https://www.nishina.riken.jp/ribf/){:target="\blank"} in Japan,
[FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/){:target="\blank"} and
[Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/phy-0){:target="\blank"} in the U.S.A.

Feel free to check my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications){:target="\_blank"}
and [presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks){:target="\_blank"} and if you have
questions, don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:{{site.email}}).
