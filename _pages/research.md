The carbon in your DNA, the oxygen you are breathing, the indium in the computer screen you are using right now, they all have been forged during the lives and explosive deaths of the stars we see in the night sky. I am trying to tackle the question, **"What is the origin of the chemical elements?"** The rarest elements, such as gold, silver and platinum, are forged in the most violent explosions in the universe, such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. My research focuses on determining what exactly comes out of these explosive environments from an experimental, theoretical and observational perspective.

In my research in nuclear astrophysics, I strive to take a **holistic approach**: to begin with, I study which are the most important nuclear physics ingredients for the evolution of astrophysical environments via **nucleosynthesis calculations** based on state-of-the art theoretical stellar modeling. Then I study these important nuclear processes by performing **experiments in radioactive ion beam facilities** around the world. These experiments will reduce the uncertainties of the stellar models and improve our current understanding of the production of the rarest elements. Finally, I am using the latest **observational data** to test our theories of nucleosynthesis and plan future experiments and theoretical studies.

I am currently proposing and conducting experiments, in collaboration with other researchers, at nuclear physics facilities around the world, such as [TRIUMF](https://triumf.ca) in Canada, [RIKEN](https://www.nishina.riken.jp/ribf/){:target="\blank"} in Japan, [GSI](https://gsi.de/en/){:target="\blank"} in Germany, [FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/){:target="\blank"}, [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/phy-0){:target="\blank"} and [TUNL](https://tunl.duke.edu/) in the U.S.A.
