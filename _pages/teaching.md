From anonymous student evaluations:
<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; He was really helpful with explanation when we were stuck with some concepts. Explained in a patient and relatable way. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; He was very encouraging to all students and helped create a very positive learning environment (even if you got the wrong answer he was encouraging) 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; Love how he explained many times until you understand the concept. Very patient, and he made physics less scary.

#### [ASTRON 2B03: The Big Questions](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=13&coid=101479){:target="\_blank"}
Ultimate questions in modern science are surveyed with emphasis on physical sciences: origin of space-time, elements and structure in the cosmos (stars, planets, galaxies).

<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>&nbsp; Leading tutorials.

From anonymous student evaluations:
<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; He always had extra, additional information to give us on the topics. Not only did it make the concepts more clear, but it made the tutorials more interesting. Also, he was very approachable and really promoted a team atmosphere to the tutorial. I feel that our tutorial was pretty "close" in the sense that we all were comfortable speaking and building off one anothers' ideas.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; I loved how approachable he was! He made me feel really comfortable asking questions and talking to him in general :) I've never had such an approachable/friendly TA before actually! 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp; He was always very clear and was knowledgeable about a vast number of things.

#### [ARTSSCI 2D06: Physics](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=38&coid=202108){:target="\_blank"}
This course explores many of the great concepts of physics in a quantitative way. Beginning with Newtonian mechanics, it moves into Einsteinâ€™s relativity, wave phenomena, atomic physics, quantum mechanics and cosmology. Selected laboratory projects will be carried out.
