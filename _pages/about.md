I am a postdoctoral research scholar in the nuclear astrophysics group at the [Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory](https://tunl.duke.edu/) and [North Carolina State University](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) working with Profs.  [Christian Iliadis](https://iliadis.web.unc.edu/) and [Richard Longland](https://rlongland.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. from [McMaster University](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/) in Canada under the supervision of Prof. [Alan Chen](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~chenal/nuc_astro_struc/personal/) on experimental nuclear astrophysics and I have previously worked at [Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt](https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/astro/home.php) in Germany with Prof. [Almudena Arcones](https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/astro/people/people_arcones.php).

My area of expertise is [nuclear astrophysics]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), the interdisciplinary scientific branch that studies the interconnection between the lives of the stars and the origin of the chemical elements in the cosmos.

 I am an avid science communicator, participating in several [science outreach]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach) activities and I enjoy writing on my [personal blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) about science, philosophy, art and other interesting topics.
