I am a postdoctoral researcher at the theoretical astrophysics group at
[Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt](https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/astro/home.php) in Germany working with Prof. [Almudena Arcones](https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/astro/people/people_arcones.php). I received my Ph.D. from [McMaster University](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/) in Canada under the supervision of Prof. [Alan Chen](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~chenal/nuc_astro_struc/personal/) on experimental nuclear astrophysics.

My area of expertise is [nuclear astrophysics]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), the interdisciplinary scientific branch that studies the interconnection between the lives of the stars and the origin of the chemical elements in the cosmos.

 I am an avid science communicator, participating in several [science outreach]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach) activities and I enjoy writing on my [personal blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) about science, philosophy, art and other interesting topics.
