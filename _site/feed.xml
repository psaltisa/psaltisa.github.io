    <p>This article highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and spontaneous interactions in fostering innovation. With remote work, creating intentional opportunities for idea exchange is crucial. Examples include NASA’s “Monday Notes” and proactive information sharing among hospital interns. Encouraging diverse reading and idea cross-pollination can also enhance creativity and innovation.</p>

and Freya India</p>

    <p>An article about how social media makes us worse people. There is some discussion regarding efforts in the UK to limit children’s smartphone use, highlighting initiatives by individuals like Daisy Greenwell and Clare Reynolds, and the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. It examines the negative impact of social media on children’s mental health and development, sharing disturbing testimonies from teens. Good read to understand the issue with social media use and young people.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Every social media app is toxic. There are a lot of nasty people on there — and nasty stuff. The TikTok For You page and Instagram Reels are the worst for showing really gruesome videos, like people getting seriously hurt or their arm being cut off.</p>

by Nigel Warburton</p>

    <p>This article discusses how Soviet Marxist philosophy influenced postwar quantum theory, particularly through the work of physicist David Bohm. It explores how Soviet ideology shaped scientific discourse and contributed to the development of Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics, which emphasized a deterministic universe in contrast to the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Chess grips its exponent, shackling the mind and brain so that the inner freedom and independence of even the strongest character cannot remain unaffected.</p>

  <p>-Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I enjoy playing chess a lot. I learned to play when I was a kid and picked it
up again during grad school. There is an interesting game flowing in the
internet between Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer, that supposedly took place at
Princeton in 1933, when they were both working there. The game was first
published in Freude am Schach (The Pleasure of Chess) by Gerhard Henschel in
1959, but it is not officially confimed that it actually took place.</p>

<p>The game began with one of the most common openings, the Spanish (Ruy Lopez),
demonstrating that both Einstein and Oppenheimer had tipped their toes into
chess theory. The first few moves flow naturally, with Einstein’s 5. Bb3
revealing his intent to apply pressure on the f7 square and focus on the kingside.</p>

<p>As the game progressed, Einstein let Oppenheimer capture his e pawn 6. Nxe4,
but responded by moving his kingside rook in the middle of the board. A few
moves later 10. Nxe5, Oppenheimer chooses to retreat his knight, instead of
exchanging, but that allows 11. Qf3 to create a strong attack in the f7 square.</p>

<p>Oppenheimer blunders 11 ..f6, trying to kick out the knight, but Einstein
finds 12. Qh5+, which starts a serious attack on the black king. Einstein
sacrificed his kinght in 13. Nxg6, to get the rook, explointing the pinned
knight in e7, and gets a large advantage.</p>

<p>After some exchanges, we get to a very nice move by
Einstein, 21. Nc4. Oppenheimer captures the knight, but then exchanges his
queen for a rook, and the game is completely lost for him, with no viable
options for his king. After 24. Bxe7, J. Robert Oppenheimer resigns and Albert
Einstein gets a well-deserved victory.</p>

<p>While this chess game might not be as celebrated as the scientific achievements of both players, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the strategic minds of two remarkable physicists. The game’s intricate tactics, sacrifices, and brilliant positional maneuvers mirror the thought processes that guided their groundbreaking research in physics.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Einstein’s connection to chess extended beyond this game. He had the privilege of knowing Emanuel Lasker, the longest-reigning World Chess Champion in history. Lasker’s presence and teachings undoubtedly influenced Einstein’s approach to the game, adding an extra layer of depth to Einstein’s engagement with chess.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> <i> What we do in nuclear [astro]physics,
is that we study how the different elements in the periodic table
are created. Everything that we see in our everyday life, is made [out] of
some substance, some [chemical] elements. For example, you have calcium
in your bones, you have iron in your red blood cells [and Christian
was saying that iron is very stable]. All these different elements,
with a few exceptions, like hydrogen and helium, all of this different
material that we see and make all this exotic and this beauty in
the world and the rest of the universe are created in stars. Like
the stars that we see in the night sky, they create inside their
hearts the different elements that make up ourselves. What’s really
amazing, and one of the reasons I decided to follow this research, is
that I learned that all of us are connected, because we are made of
exactly the same material and we are coming from the same source. The material
that makes up the Solar system comes from a huge cloud, a nebula [same as the
one that Christian told us from the children’s book] we are made of the same
substance, 4.5 billion years ago. We might live in very different places, you
are in South Africa and I am in Germany, but we are connected; not only [with]
humans, but we are also connected to the trees and the animals and the
beautiful mountains of South Africa. We are all made out of exactly the same
material. What I am doing for my research is that I am trying to understand
why some elements are more common that others. We have lots of oxygen, lots of
carbon, but we don’t have not lots of gold [it would be nice to have lots of gold!].
I am using big laboratories, like iTHEMBA, to try to recreate what happens
inside stars, how stars create these different elements. And they are paying me to
do that, and to travel to nice laces like South Africa for conferences!
Pretty cool deal right?</i></p>

Looking back in all the books I have read through this year, I made a list of the five titles that I enjoyed the most. Once again, I failed to include any fiction book in my reading list, but I hope to do that next year. In the following list you will find a diverse cohort of non-fiction titles that covers topics such as Jungian archetypes, science communication and physical exercise. In case you are interested in other book recommendations, you can also check my lists for <a href="/blog/2020/favourite-books/">2020</a> and <a href="/blog/2021/favourite-books/">2021</a>.

<h3 id="exercised-by-daniel-lieberman"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49358915-exercised">Exercised</a> by Daniel Lieberman</h3>

<p>I found out about this book from an episode on the COMPLEXITY <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5B0iBgaktGONqOszrTVtyl?si=21f8e4fcff1d45ae">podcast</a>. Daniel Lieberman is a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard and in “Exercised” he takes on the history of exercise from a unique perspective. Lieberman asks several questions, such as why even though exercise is necessary for our survival, we tend take it easy whenever possible? He uses all the latest studies in both anthropology and evolutionary biology to answer these questions. The key idea of the book is that we did not evolve to exercise, in the sense of doing voluntary physical activity for the sake of health. We rather had physical activity incorporated in our lifestyle, which has evolved over the years, and in the modern western society we tend to lead sedentary lives, which also are causing deceases that our ancestors were not even aware of. A great book that combines ideas from different fields of research.</p>

<h3 id="king-warrior-magician-lover-by-douglas-gillette-and-robert-moore"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range:_Why_Generalists_Triumph_in_a_Specialized_World">King, Warrior, Magician, Lover</a> by Douglas Gillette and Robert Moore</h3>

<p>I have always had an interest in psychology, and I came across this title while watching a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4unDD4OUUNQ&amp;list=PLeYgLtAkHH0h1Bbk09DcYhee7EjajC-iN&amp;index=9">YouTube</a> regarding archetypes in cinema. According to Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychiatrist, the soul - or psyche - was made of the ego, the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The archetypes are a result of the collective, shared ancestral memories that one can find hidden in art, literature and religion. In this book, Gillette and Moore take on the archetypes that define masculinity, namely the King, the Warrior, the Magician and the Lover, and analyze them. Each archetype can be represented with a triangle: the bottom corners represent the bi-polar shadow-split of the archetype, and the top the archetype in its fullness. A nice book for men of all ages.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-legacies-by-david-kaiser"><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/Q/bo49298912.html">Quantum Legacies</a> by David Kaiser</h3>

<p>I have a soft spot for the history of quantum theory, and this recent book by David Kaiser was the perfect treat for me. In it we can find essays about the scientists behind this great revolution in physics, and learn about its history and influence in the Western societies of the 20th century. Kaiser’s writing style is really enjoyable, and I highly recommend his other books, such as the <a href="https://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/">How the Hippies Saved Physics</a>. If you want to learn more about the book, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bto63uWOtU">interview</a>.</p>

<p>I came across this great book while looking for science communication literature. Alan Alda is a famous actor and author, and hosted the Scientific American Frontiers, a television show that explored cutting-edge advances in science and technology. In this book, Alda argues that empathy can be used to enhance communication. He also discusses how improv can help better communicate ideas (remember this <a href="/blog/2022/media-sampler-2/">blog post</a>?).</p>

<h3 id="your-money-or-your-life-by-vicki-robin-and-joseph-r-dominguez"><a href="https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/">Your money or your life</a> by Vicki Robin and Joseph R. Dominguez</h3>

<p>The fifth book of my list is one of the classics for personal finance by Vicki Robin and Joseph Dominguez. The first edition of the book was published back in 1992 (the year I was born!), but I actually read the revised version of 2008. The goal of this book is to change our relationship with money through a 9-step program. It is the “bible” for FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early), which is a lifestyle movement preaching that a frugal lifestyle in combination with aggressive investments can lead to a large accumulation of assets that allows one to retire early and live off this money. I found many of these ideas in the book useful, and I highly recommend it to my fellow Millennials.</p>

<p>Zoom meetings offered a solution during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-downs to keep in touch with colleagues and family. Nowadays more people than ever are using videoconferencing tools for work. Every week, knowledge workers around the world spend many hours in front of a flat-screen discussing with their collaborators and trying to come up with ideas. How does this new alternative affect the post-pandemic work?</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y">study</a>, published in Nature, by Melanie Brucks from Columbia Business School and Jonathan Levav from Stanford School of Business studied how these tools for virtual collaboration affect creative idea generation. The researchers performed experiments, using more than 600 volunteers who were paired up to perform a creativity task, such as finding alternative uses for a Frisbee. Half of them did that in person, and half over Zoom. The researchers found that the first group had around 20% more creative ideas compared to the virtual group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> (S)imply being at the same physical place as somebody else, improves idea generation.</p>

  <p>-Melanie Brucks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main results of this work are that videoconferencing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>inhibits the production of creative ideas, but</li>
  <li>it does not affect the effectiveness of idea selection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another interesting finding from this work that could explain the lack of creative ideas using videoconferencing tools is our fixation to our partners. The participants in the virtual group spent almost two times more time looking at their partners compared to the in-person one. Our minds are much better in creating creative ideas when we let our senses more free and when we are less focused.</p>

<p>Brucks and Levav’s work is a very interesting and provides some valuable input in a question that many knowledge workers had when the pandemic started: how is <a href="/blog/tag/creativity/">creativity</a> affected by virtual interactions. Next time you have a zoom meeting to come up with a creative idea, maybe you should consider turning off your camera!</p>
