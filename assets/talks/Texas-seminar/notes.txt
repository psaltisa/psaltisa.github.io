DRAGON slide

- standard configuration
- use of LaBr detectors for precise resonance energy calculations
- two stage M and E
- Time of flights (local-separator)
- Hybrid detector (DSSSD+IC)

- recoil separators are designed with an intrinsic acceptance limit
- lower mass nuclei produce large momentum angles that can surpass the
  acceptance of the separator (putting your hand in a hose and spray)
