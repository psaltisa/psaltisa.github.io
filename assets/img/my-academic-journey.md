## My academic journey

My first memory of being involved with anything scientific-like is watching kids
documentaries on dinosaurs, search of alien civilizations and some science books
for kids my parents were bought to my sister and I.

I remember being generally curious about all things. I wasn't asking so many
questions to my parents, like my older sister, but I really enjoyed checking
all kinds of different things in the Greek version of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica,
and some smaller reference books that we had in my parents' house. There I was
reading about dinosaurs, foreign countries, animals and many more.

I think I did the first big step towards choosing science as a profession in
Grade 3, at around 8-9 years old. Our teacher, Mr. Nikos, was a very passionate
person and he encouraged me to be more inquisitive. I remember that I wrote a
short essay about Einstein for our science class, which should be getting dusty
somewhere in my parents' house.

At junior high school I had already starting training seriously in track and
field and my main focus was how to be the best athlete, even though I was keep
being top of my class at school. Around Grades 8-9 I started getting a bit more
broad on my interests. Instead of focusing in science, I started reading books
on other subjects, such as biology, chemistry, history and even theology. It was
a very fun period, because during my kind of limited time of studying, since I
was also training 3-4 times a week and had classes in English and French, I was
studying from different sources and learned a lot. I still remember the suprise
in my classmates' faces one day when I were explaining to them Freud's theory
of Psychosexual development!

During the high school years I didn't have a clear idea on what I want to study
at university. My interests were varied from physics and astronomy, to psychology
to programming. Probably one of the causes that brought me closer to physics was
a course on astronomy I took in Grade 11. The course itself wasn' anything
spectacular, however it gave me the opportunity to look a bit more on other sources.
At the time there was a Greek TV documentary series running in state TV which
was presented by two astronomy professors at University of Athens. I really enjoyed
this show - it turned out that the profs were not so great at the university!

I can definitely identify two reasons that helped me decide to study physics at
the university. The first one was Carl Sagan. One day in Grade 11 or 12, I came
across some DVDs of his Cosmos series and I was absolutely stunned by his way of
talking about science and all the visuals of the show. The second one was my physics
tutor, Mr. Tourgelis. He had a very exciting way of conveying information and he
was always very encouraging to my interest in science. I remember it was few days
before the national entry exams, and I still wasn't sure about what I want to study.
During the last physics class with Mr. Tourgelis we went through all the material
we covered together and then I decided that I want to study physics.
