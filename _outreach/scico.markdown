 In 2015 I joined [SciCo](https://scico.gr/en){:target="\_blank"}  - abbreviation of <b>Sci</b>ence <b>Co</b>mmunication -
 the first Non Profit Science Communication Organisation in Greece. 
 As an ambassador, I attended trainings on creative writing, storytelling and science communication. 
 A small project I am participating at the moment is the creation of comics that enhance the interest 
 about science in an informative but fun way (You can view some of them 
 [here](https://www.facebook.com/401524586540479/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1316190958407166){:target="\_blank"} - in Greek ). 
 I was also part of the organizing team at the biggest Science Festival in Greece with more than 30,000 visitors - 
 [Athens Science Festival](http://www.athens-science-festival.gr/en/team_category/organisational-team/){:target="\_blank"}.
