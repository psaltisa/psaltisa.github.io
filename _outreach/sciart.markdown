["The Bridge"](http://www.sciartinitiative.org/the-bridge.html){:target="\_blank"} is a four-month 
virtual residency program (September-January), where artists and scientists are paired to collaborate on a 
project of their choice. Collaborating can generate new ideas and provide new perspectives which can lead 
to innovation in existing fields or the creation of new ones.

In the fall of 2015 I was selected from the [Sciart initiative](http://www.sciartinitiative.org){:target="\_blank"}
as a Bridge resident. My collaborator was [Matej Vakula](http://vakula.eu/home-en.html){:target="\_blank"},
a NY based artist with an interest for astrophysics. Due to my involvement with the McCallion Planetarium, we decided
to work on a production of a full-dome movie about nuclear astrophysics, named "The DRAGON theorem", inspired from the 
experiment I was working for my Ph.D. thesis. You can find more about this from an [interview]({% post_url 2017-11-20-TRIUMF-interview %}){:target="\_blank"}
I gave to TRIUMF media team about it.

The story explores the evolution of natural philosophy from ancient Greece (Democritus, Heraclitus and others) since the era of Quantum Physics and Theory of Relativity in a non-linear narrative and discusses the existential relationship between knowledge, fundamental research, culture and nature. During the movie, nuclear physics experimental data from TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver will be manipulated and visualized using Autodesk Maya and ROOT to help the audience becoming aware of their profound connection 
with the cosmic web as its living part.

Matej and I were keeping a <a href="http://www.sciartinitiative.org/group-4-matej--thanassis" target="_blank">weekly blog</a>
where we were discussing our progress and ideas. We are currently working in the production of the movie.
