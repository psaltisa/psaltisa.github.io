  abstract= {Reactions on proton-rich nuclides drive the nucleosynthesis in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in x-ray bursts (XRBs). CCSNe eject the nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium and hence are a potential inventory of p nuclei, whereas in XRBs nucleosynthesis powers the light curves. In both astrophysical sites the Ni-Cu cycle, which features a competition between 59Cu(p,α)56Ni and 59Cu(p,γ)60Zn, could potentially halt the production of heavier elements. Here, we report the first direct measurement of 59Cu(p,α)56Ni using a reaccelerated 59Cu beam and a cryogenic solid hydrogen target. Our results show that the reaction proceeds predominantly to the ground state of 56Ni, and the experimental rate has been found to be lower than Hauser-Feshbach based statistical model predictions. New results hints that the νp process could operate at higher temperatures than previously inferred and therefore remains a viable site for synthesizing the heavier elements.},

    abstract = {We investigate the post-explosion phase in core-collapse supernovae with 2D hydrodynamical simulations and a simple neutrino treatment. The latter allows us to perform 46 simulations and follow the evolution of the 32 explosion models during several seconds. We present a broad study based on three progenitors (11.2, 15, and 27 M⊙), different neutrino heating efficiencies, and various rotation rates. We show that the first seconds after shock revival determine the final explosion energy, remnant mass, and properties of ejected matter. Our results suggest that a continued mass accretion increases the explosion energy even at late times. We link the late-time mass accretion to initial conditions such as rotation strength and shock deformation at explosion time. Only some of our simulations develop a neutrino-driven wind (NDW) that survives for several seconds. This indicates that NDWs are not a standard feature expected after every successful explosion. Even if our neutrino treatment is simple, we estimate the nucleosynthesis of the exploding models for the 15 M⊙ progenitor after correcting the neutrino energies and luminosities to get a more realistic electron fraction.}

  abstract={Background: Light (30≤Z≤45) neutron-rich isotopes are thought to be synthesized in the neutrino-driven ejecta of core-collapse supernovae explosions via the weak r process. Recent nucleosynthesis studies have demonstrated that (α,xn) reactions play a particularly important role in the production of these isotopes. α-nucleus optical model potentials (α-OMPs) are used to model this nucleosynthesis scenario.

Purpose: The different α-OMP model parameters can affect the calculated cross sections by more than an order of magnitude in the relevant energy regions, which affects the production of light neutron-rich isotopes. Consequently, to constrain the astrophysical conditions characterizing the supernovae ejecta, the uncertainty of the nuclear physics input has to be reduced.

Methods: The cross section of the 100Mo(α,n)103Ru reaction was measured by means of the activation method. 0.5 mm thick molybdenum disks were irradiated with Eα = 7.0 to Eα = 13.0 MeV α beams. Thick target yields and reaction cross sections were determined via γ-ray spectroscopy.

Results: Cross sections at several energies below the Coulomb barrier were measured, reaching the astrophysically relevant energy region. Large discrepancies between the experimental values and statistical model predictions calculated using the well-known α-OMPs were found. The measured cross section data could be excellently described by the Atomki-V2 potential. Therefore, this α-OMP was used to derive the astrophysical reaction rates as a function of temperature.

Conclusions: The successful reproduction of the measured cross sections in a wide energy region confirm the reliability of the Atomki-V2 potential. The usage of the new 100Mo(α,n)103Ru experimental data along with the Atomki-V2 potential reduces the nuclear uncertainties of the weak r-process production yields of nuclei with 36≤Z≤50 to a marginal level.},

  abstract={   Radiative capture reactions play a pivotal role for our understanding of the origin of the elements in the cosmos. Recoil separators provide an effective way to study these reactions, in inverse kinematics, and take advantage of the use of radioactive ion beams. However, a limiting factor in the study of radiative capture reactions in inverse kinematics is the momentum spread of the product nuclei, which can result in an angular spread larger than the geometric acceptance of the separator. The DRAGON facility at TRIUMF is a versatile recoil separator, designed to study radiative capture reactions relevant to astrophysics in the A∼10−30 region. In this work we present the first attempt to study with DRAGON a reaction, 6Li(α,γ)10B, for which the recoil angular spread exceeds DRAGON's acceptance. Our result is in good agreement with the literature value, showing that DRAGON can measure resonance strengths of astrophysically important reactions even when not all the recoils enter the separator.

  journal = {Physical Review C},
  arxiv= {1910.01698},
  pdf={papers/A005-Williams-PRC-2020.pdf},
  abstract={Background: Globular clusters are known to exhibit anomalous abundance trends such as the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation. This trend is thought to arise via pollution of the cluster interstellar medium from a previous generation of stars. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars undergoing hot bottom burning (HBB) are a prime candidate for producing sodium-rich oxygen-poor material, and then expelling this material via strong stellar winds. The amount of 23Na produced in this environment has been shown to be sensitive to uncertainties in the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate. The 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction is also activated in classical nova nucleosynthesis, strongly influencing predicted isotopic abundance ratios in the Na-Al region. Therefore, improved nuclear physics uncertainties for this reaction rate are of critical importance for the identification and classification of pre-solar grains produced by classical novae.

Purpose: At temperatures relevant for both HBB in AGB stars and classical nova nucleosynthesis, the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate is dominated by narrow resonances, with additional contribution from direct capture. This study presents new strength values for seven resonances, as well as a study of direct capture.

Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics by impinging an intense isotopically pure beam of 22Ne onto a windowless H2 gas target. The 23Na recoils and prompt γ rays were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass separator coupled to a 4π bismuth-germanate scintillator array surrounding the target.

Results: For the low-energy resonances, located at center of mass energies of 149, 181, and 248 keV, we recover stength values of ωγ149=0.17+0.05−0.04, ωγ181=2.2±0.4, and ωγ248=8.2±0.7 μeV, respectively. These results are in broad agreement with recent studies performed by the LUNA and TUNL groups. However, for the important reference resonance at 458 keV we obtain a strength value of ωγ458=0.44±0.02 eV, which is significantly lower than recently reported values. This is the first time that this resonance has been studied completely independently from other resonance strengths. For the 632-keV resonance we recover a strength value of ωγ632=0.48±0.02 eV, which is an order of magnitude higher than a recent study. For reference resonances at 610- and 1222-keV, our strength values are in agreement with the literature. In the case of direct capture, we recover an S factor of 60 keV b, consistent with prior forward kinematics experiments.

Conclusions: In summary, we have performed the first direct measurement of 22Ne(p,γ)23Na in inverse kinematics. Our results are in broad agreement with the literature, with the notable exception of the 458-keV resonance, for which we obtain a lower strength value. We assessed the impact of the present reaction rate in reference to a variety of astrophysical environments, including AGB stars and classical novae. Production of 23Na in AGB stars is minimally influenced by the factor of 4 increase in the present rate compared to the STARLIB-2013 compilation. The present rate does however impact upon the production of nuclei in the Ne-Al region for classical novae, with dramatically improved uncertainties in the predicted isotopic abundances present in the novae ejecta.},

  abstract={In this Letter we report on the first inverse kinematics measurement of key resonances in the reaction which forms part of the NeNa cycle, and is relevant for 23Na synthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. An anti-correlation in O and Na abundances is seen across all well-studied globular clusters (GC), however, reaction-rate uncertainties limit the precision as to which stellar evolution models can reproduce the observed isotopic abundance patterns. Given the importance of GC observations in testing stellar evolution models and their dependence on NeNa reaction rates, it is critical that the nuclear physics uncertainties on the origin of 23Na be addressed. We present results of direct strengths measurements of four key resonances in at E = 149 keV, 181 keV, 248 keV and 458 keV. The strength of the important E = 458 keV reference resonance has been determined independently of other resonance strengths for the first time with an associated strength of ωγ = 0.439(22) eV and with higher precision than previously reported. Our result deviates from the two most recently published results obtained from normal kinematics measurements performed by the LENA and LUNA collaborations but is in agreement with earlier measurements. The impact of our rate on the Na-pocket formation in AGB stars and its relation to the O-Na anti-correlation was assessed via network calculations. Further, the effect on isotopic abundances in CO and ONe novae ejecta with respect to pre-solar grains was investigated.},

  abstract= {Background: One of the primary objectives of the field of Nuclear Astrophysics is the study of the elemental and isotopic abundances in the universe. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms behind the production of a large number of nuclides in the isotopic chart, there are still many open questions regarding a number of neutron-deficient nuclei, the p nuclei. To that end, experimentally deduced nuclear reaction cross sections can provide invaluable input to astrophysical models.

Purpose: The reactions 107,109Ag(p,γ)108,110Cd have been studied at energies inside the astrophysically relevant energy window in an attempt to provide experimental data required for the testing of reaction-rate predictions in terms of the statistical model of Hauser-Feshbach around the p nucleus 108Cd.

Methods: The experiments were performed with in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy with proton beams accelerated by the Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator at NCSR “Demokritos” impinging a target of natural silver. A set of high-purity germanium detectors was employed to record the emitted radiation.

Results: A first set of total cross-section measurements in radiative proton-capture reactions involving 107,109Ag, producing the p-nucleus 108Cd, inside the astrophysically relevant energy window is reported. The experimental results are compared to theoretical calculations, using talys. An overall good agreement between the data and the theoretical calculations has been found.

Conclusions: The results reported in this work add new information to the relatively unexplored p process. The present measurements can serve as a reference point in understanding the nuclear parameters in the related astrophysical environments and for future theoretical modeling and experimental works.},

  abstract={Measurements of nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments are considered quite important for the understanding of nuclear structure both near and far from the valley of stability. The recent advent of radioactive beams has resulted in a plethora of new, continuously flowing, experimental data on nuclear structure – including nuclear moments – which hinders the information management. A new, dedicated, public and user friendly online database (http://magneticmoments.info) has been created comprising experimental data of nuclear electromagnetic moments. The present database supersedes existing printed compilations, including also non-evaluated series of data and relevant meta-data, while putting strong emphasis on bimonthly updates. The scope, features and extensions of the database are reported.},
