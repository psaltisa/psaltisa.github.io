  abstract={Presolar graphite grains carry the isotopic signatures of their parent stars. A significant fraction of presolar graphites show isotopic abundance anomalies relative to solar for elements such as O, Si, Mg, and Ca, which are compatible with nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Therefore, they must have condensed from CCSN ejecta before the formation of the Sun. Their most puzzling abundance signature is the 22Ne-enriched component Ne-E(L), interpreted as the effect of the radioactive decay of 22Na (T1/2 = 2.6 yr). Previous works have shown that if H is ingested into the He shell and not fully destroyed before the explosion, the CCSN shock in the He-shell material produces large amounts of 22Na. Here we focus on such CCSN models, showing a radioactive 26Al production compatible with grain measurements, and analyze the conditions of 22Na nucleosynthesis. In these models, 22Na is mostly made in the He shell, with a total ejected mass varying between 2.6 × 10−3 M⊙ and 1.9 × 10−6 M⊙. We show that such 22Na may already impact the CCSN light curve 500 days after the explosion, and at later stages it can be the main source powering the CCSN light curve for up to a few years before 44Ti decay becomes dominant. Based on the CCSN yields above, the 1274.53 keV γ-ray flux due to 22Na decay could be observable for years after the first CCSN light is detected, depending on the distance. This makes CCSNe possible sites to detect a 22Na γ-ray signature consistently with the Ne-E(L) component found in presolar graphites. Finally, we discuss the potential contribution from 22Na decay to the Galactic positron annihilation rate.}

  abstract={Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main-sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta differently from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of subsolar-metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu–Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities Z = 2 × 10−9, 10−7, 2 × 10−6, and 2 × 10−5, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.}

  abstract={Approximately 30%–40% of classical novae generate dust between 20 and 100 days following the eruption. However, there has yet to be a definitive identification of presolar stardust grains originating from classical novae. While multiple studies have suggested a nova origin for specific grains, aligning simultaneously all measured isotopic ratios of a specific grain with those predicted from simulations remains challenging. Using Monte Carlo simulations, this work investigates how uncertainties in thermonuclear reaction rates influence the isotopic ratios predicted in simulations of classical novae, specifically impacting the identification of presolar grains. In particular, we address two questions: (i) What is the impact of uncertainties in reaction rates on the range of isotopic ratios predicted by classical nova simulations? (ii) Which reaction rate uncertainties most significantly influence the predicted abundance ratios in presolar grains? Our results show that current reaction rate uncertainties affect the isotopic ratios of 12C/13C, 14N/15N, 16O/17O, 16O/18O, 24Mg/25Mg, 24Mg/26Mg, 26Al/27Al, and 28Si/29Si by less than 20% in either carbon–oxygen or oxygen–neon (ONe) novae, especially when considering the mixing of matter throughout the entire envelope. However, the isotopic ratios of 28Si/30Si, 32S/33S, and 32S/34S in ONe novae are exceptions: their variability greatly exceeds a factor of 2 due to the uncertainties in the reaction rates of 30P(p,γ)31S, 33S(p,γ)34Cl, and 34S(p,γ)35Cl, respectively. These results highlight the significant influence of specific reaction rates on the predicted abundance ratios and underscore the necessity for accurate nuclear measurements to reduce these uncertainties.}

  abstract = {β-decay properties play an important role in most astrophysical processes. In the absence of experimental data, astrophysical models rely on global theoretical calculations to provide the relevant properties. It is therefore important to provide strong experimental constraints when possible. In the case of β-decay, the most sensitive probe is the β-decay strength distribution. We report here on the first measurement of the latter quantity for the β+ decay of 60Ga using the total absorption spectroscopy technique. The experimental results are compared to theoretical calculations often used in astrophysical models, namely the shell model and the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA), as well as an extension of QRPA that includes higher-order nucleonic calculations. Both models are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results.}

  abstract={Observed abundances of Z ∼ 40 elements in metal-poor stars vary from star to star, indicating that the rapid and slow neutron capture processes may not contribute alone to the synthesis of elements beyond iron. The weak r-process was proposed to produce Z ∼ 40 elements in a subset of old stars. Thought to occur in the ν-driven ejecta of a core-collapse supernova, (α, xn) reactions would drive the nuclear flow toward heavier masses at T = 2−5 GK. However, current comparisons between modeled and observed yields do not bring satisfactory insights into the stellar environment, mainly due to the uncertainties of the nuclear physics inputs where the dispersion in a given reaction rate often exceeds 1 order of magnitude. Involved rates are calculated with the statistical model where the choice of an α-optical-model potential (αOMP) leads to such a poor precision. The first experiment on 87Rb(α, xn) reactions at weak r-process energies is reported here. Total inclusive cross sections were assessed at Ec.m. = 8.1−13 MeV (3.7−7.6 GK) with the active target MUlti-Sampling Ionization Chamber. With an N = 50 seed nucleus, the measured values agree with statistical model estimates using the αOMP Atomki-V2. A reevaluated reaction rate was incorporated into new nucleosynthesis calculations, focusing on ν-driven ejecta conditions known to be sensitive to this specific rate. These conditions were found to fail to reproduce the lighter heavy element abundances in metal-poor stars.}

In particular, our measurement of 94Sr⁢(α,n)⁢97Zr is the first weak 𝑟-process reaction cross section obtained using a radioactive ion beam. This experiment was enabled by the use of novel solid helium targets, comprised of silicon thin films with high helium incorporation obtained via a sputtering technique. Yield measurements were performed at center-of-mass energies of 10.4 and 9.0 MeV for the 86Kr⁢(𝛼,𝑛)⁢89Sr reaction, and 9.9 MeV for 94Sr⁢(α,n)⁢97Zr, extending into the respective Gamow energy windows for a temperature of 5 GK. Reactions were uniquely identified by prompt γ rays detected in coincidence with heavy ions selected by a recoil mass spectrometer. The obtained cross sections are smaller than predicted for both reactions. In the case of 94Sr⁢(α,n)⁢97Zr, the reaction rate found here is lowered by an order of magnitude at temperatures below 5 GK, which is expected to impact the predicted abundance of ruthenium, a signature weak 𝑟-process element.}

This approach results in a background reduction factor of about 1 order of magnitude, enabling the first measurement of a (𝑝, 𝑛) cross section in a storage ring. Here, the reaction channels 124Xe⁢(𝑝,𝑛) and 124Xe⁢(𝑝,𝛾) have been studied just above the neutron threshold energy. The new data provide valuable constraints for Hauser-Feshbach theory and extrapolation of the (𝑝,𝛾) cross section to lower energies. Most importantly, for nuclei of limited availability, the method represents a powerful improvement to efficiently study proton-induced reactions at energies within or close to the astrophysical Gamow window, bringing many reaction measurements within reach that were previously inaccessible in the laboratory.}

  abstract= {Context. Nuclear networks are widely used coupled with hydrodynamical simulations of explosive scenarios to account for the change of nuclear species and energy generation rate due to nuclear reactions. In this way, there is a feedback mechanism between the hydrodynamical state and the nuclear processes. Unfortunately, the timescale of nuclear reactions is orders of magnitude smaller than the dynamical timescale that drives hydrodynamical simulations. Therefore, these nuclear networks are usually very small, reduced in most cases to a dozen elements, especially when simulations are carried out in more than one dimension.

Aims. We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf.

Methods. We perform several tests that are relevant to simulate explosive scenarios, such as Type Ia supernovae and core-collapse supernovae. We compare the results of the 90 nuclei network with a standard α-chain network with 14 elements to evaluate the differences in the energy generation rate. We also evaluate the relevance of including the electrons in the network in terms of generated yields and how it affects the pressure of a degenerate fluid such as that of white dwarfs. The results obtained with the 90-nuclei network have been verified with a much larger 2000-nuclei network built from REACLIB (WinNet), in terms of nuclear energy generation rate, pressure, and produced yields.

Results. The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with WinNet in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.

Conclusions. A nuclear network with N = 90 species, including electrons, aimed at multidimensional calculations of supernova explosions is described and verified. The proposed network is suitable for the study of Type Ia supernova explosions because it provides better values of pressure and electron abundance than other existing networks with smaller or even a similar size but without including electron capture processes.}

  abstract={The elemental abundances between strontium and silver (Z = 38–47) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-
poor stars in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak r-process and νp-process occurring in early core-
collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state
model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction.
The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations,
with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven
outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful
combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr–Zr (Z = 38–40), while
the proton-rich ones, Mo–Pd (Z = 42–47)}

The new 22Mg(α,p)25Al reaction rate is a factor of ∼4 higher than the previous direct measurement of this reaction within temperatures relevant for x-ray bursts, resulting in the 22Mg waiting point of x-ray burst nucleosynthesis flow to be significantly bypassed via the (α,p) reaction.}

  abstract ={The low-lying structure of 13Be has remained an enigma for decades. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, large inconsistencies remain. Being both unbound and one neutron away from 14Be, the heaviest bound beryllium nucleus, 13Be is difficult to study through simple reactions with weak radioactive-ion beams or more complex reactions with stable-ion beams. Here, we present the results of a study using the 12Be(d,p)13Be reaction in inverse kinematics using a 9.5 MeV per nucleon 12Be beam from the ISAC-II facility. The solid deuteron target of IRIS was used to achieve an increased areal thickness compared to conventional deuterated polyethylene targets. The Q-value spectrum below −4.4 MeV was analyzed using a Bayesian method with geant4 simulations. A three-point angular distribution with the same Q-value gate was fit with a mixture of s- and p-wave, s- and d-wave, or pure p-wave transfer. The Q-value spectrum was also compared with geant simulations obtained using the energies and widths of states reported in four previous works. It was found that our results are incompatible with works that revealed a wide 5/2+ resonance but shows better agreement with ones that reported a narrower width.}

  title = {The gamma-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. I. A novel analysis of gamma-process yields in massive stars},
  journal = {Astronomy & Astrophysics},
  abstract = {Context. The γ-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae is generally accepted as a feasible process for the synthesis of
neutron-deficient isotopes beyond iron. However, crucial discrepancies between theory and observations still exist: the average yields
of γ-process nucleosynthesis from massive stars are still insufficient to reproduce the solar distribution in galactic chemical evolution
calculations, and the yields of the Mo and Ru isotopes are a factor of ten lower than the yields of the other γ-process nuclei.
Aims. We investigate the γ-process in five sets of core-collapse supernova models published in the literature with initial masses of 15,
20, and 25 M at solar metallicity.
Methods. We compared the γ-process overproduction factors from the different models. To highlight the possible effect of nuclear
physics input, we also considered 23 ratios of two isotopes close to each other in mass relative to their solar values. Further, we
investigated the contribution of C–O shell mergers in the supernova progenitors as an additional site of the γ-process.
Results. Our analysis shows that a large scatter among the different models exists for both the γ-process integrated yields and the
isotopic ratios. We find only ten ratios that agree with their solar values, all the others differ by at least a factor of three from the solar
values in all the considered sets of models. The γ-process within C–O shell mergers mostly influences the isotopic ratios that involve
intermediate and heavy proton-rich isotopes with A > 100.
Conclusions. We conclude that there are large discrepancies both among the different data sets and between the model predictions
and the solar abundance distribution. More calculations are needed; particularly updating the nuclear network, because the majority
of the models considered in this work do not use the latest reaction rates for the γ-process nucleosynthesis. Moreover, the role of C–O
shell mergers requires further investigation.}

  We determined stellar parameters from Gaia photometry and parallaxes. Chemical abundances were derived using spectrum
  synthesis and model atmospheres. Results. We determined chemical abundances of 26 species of 18 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,
  Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Zr. For several stars, we were able to measure both neutral and ionised species,
  including Si, Sc, Mn, and Zr. We have roughly doubled the number of measurements of Cu for stars at [Fe/H] ≤ −2.5. The homogeneity
  of the sample made it possible to highlight the presence of two Zn-rich stars ([Zn/Fe]∼+0.7), one r-rich and the other r-poor. We
  report the existence of two branches in the [Zn/Fe] versus [Ni/Fe] plane and suggest that the high [Zn/Fe] branch is the result of
  hypernova nucleosynthesis. We discovered two stars with peculiar light neutron-capture abundance patterns: CES1237+1922 (also known
  as BS 16085-0050), which is ∼1 dex underabundant in Sr, Y, and Zr with respect to the other stars in the sample, and CES2250-4057
  (also known as HE 2247-4113), which shows a ∼1 dex overabundance of Sr with respect to Y and Zr. Conclusions. The high quality of our
  dataset allowed us to measure hardly detectable ions. This can provide guidance in the development of line formation computations that
  take deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and hydrodynamical effects into account.",

The intensity I260βp=8.3+1.2−0.9×10−6 represents the weakest β-delayed, charged-particle emission ever measured below 400 keV, resulting in a proton branching ratio of Γp/Γ=2.5+0.4−0.3×10−4. By combining this measurement with shell-model calculations for Γγ and past work on other resonances, the total 30P(p,γ)31S rate has been determined with reduced uncertainty. The new rate has been used in hydrodynamic simulations to model the composition of nova ejecta, leading to a concrete prediction of 30Si:28Si excesses in presolar nova grains and the calibration of nuclear thermometers.},

In cases where there are significant unknown quantities, such as energies of states, an iterative process of simulating and fitting is often required to describe experimental data. We describe a Bayesian approach to fitting experimental data, designed for data from a 12Be(d,p) reaction measurement, using simulations made with GEANT4. Q-values from the 12C(d,p) reaction to well-known states in 13C are compared with simulations using BayesOpt. The energies of the states were not included in the simulation to reproduce the situation for 13Be where the states are poorly known. Both cases had low statistics and significant resolution broadening owing to large proton energy losses in the solid deuterium target. Excitation energies of the lowest three excited states in 13C were extracted to better than 90 keV, paving a way for extracting information on 13Be.},

Our results show that the reaction proceeds predominantly to the ground state of 56Ni, and the experimental rate has been found to be lower than Hauser-Feshbach based statistical model predictions. New results hints that the νp process could operate at higher temperatures than previously inferred and therefore remains a viable site for synthesizing the heavier elements.},

We present a broad study based on three progenitors (11.2, 15, and 27 M⊙), different neutrino heating efficiencies, and various rotation rates. We show that the first seconds after shock revival determine the final explosion energy, remnant mass, and properties of ejected matter. Our results suggest that a continued mass accretion increases the explosion energy even at late times. We link the late-time mass accretion to initial conditions such as rotation strength and shock deformation at explosion time. Only some of our simulations develop a neutrino-driven wind (NDW) that survives for several seconds. This indicates that NDWs are not a standard feature expected after every successful explosion. Even if our neutrino treatment is simple, we estimate the nucleosynthesis of the exploding models for the 15 M⊙ progenitor after correcting the neutrino energies and luminosities to get a more realistic electron fraction.},

  abstract={Background: Light (30≤Z≤45) neutron-rich isotopes are thought to be synthesized in the neutrino-driven ejecta of core-collapse supernovae explosions via the weak r process. Recent nucleosynthesis studies have demonstrated that (α,xn) reactions play a particularly important role in the production of these isotopes. α-nucleus optical model potentials (α-OMPs) are used to model this nucleosynthesis scenario.

Purpose: The different α-OMP model parameters can affect the calculated cross sections by more than an order of magnitude in the relevant energy regions, which affects the production of light neutron-rich isotopes. Consequently, to constrain the astrophysical conditions characterizing the supernovae ejecta, the uncertainty of the nuclear physics input has to be reduced.

Methods: The cross section of the 100Mo(α,n)103Ru reaction was measured by means of the activation method. 0.5 mm thick molybdenum disks were irradiated with Eα = 7.0 to Eα = 13.0 MeV α beams. Thick target yields and reaction cross sections were determined via γ-ray spectroscopy.

Results: Cross sections at several energies below the Coulomb barrier were measured, reaching the astrophysically relevant energy region. Large discrepancies between the experimental values and statistical model predictions calculated using the well-known α-OMPs were found. The measured cross section data could be excellently described by the Atomki-V2 potential. Therefore, this α-OMP was used to derive the astrophysical reaction rates as a function of temperature.

Conclusions: The successful reproduction of the measured cross sections in a wide energy region confirm the reliability of the Atomki-V2 potential. The usage of the new 100Mo(α,n)103Ru experimental data along with the Atomki-V2 potential reduces the nuclear uncertainties of the weak r-process production yields of nuclei with 36≤Z≤50 to a marginal level.},

Recoil separators provide an effective way to study these reactions, in inverse kinematics, and take advantage of the use of radioactive ion beams.

The DRAGON facility at TRIUMF is a versatile recoil separator, designed to study radiative capture reactions relevant to astrophysics in the A∼10−30 region. In this work we present the first attempt to study with DRAGON a reaction, 6Li(α,γ)10B, for which the recoil angular spread exceeds DRAGON's acceptance. Our result is in good agreement with the literature value, showing that DRAGON can measure resonance strengths of astrophysically important reactions even when not all the recoils enter the separator.},

  journal = {Physical Review C},
  arxiv= {1910.01698},
  pdf={papers/A005-Williams-PRC-2020.pdf},
  abstract={Background: Globular clusters are known to exhibit anomalous abundance trends such as the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation. This trend is thought to arise via pollution of the cluster interstellar medium from a previous generation of stars. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars undergoing hot bottom burning (HBB) are a prime candidate for producing sodium-rich oxygen-poor material, and then expelling this material via strong stellar winds. The amount of 23Na produced in this environment has been shown to be sensitive to uncertainties in the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate. The 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction is also activated in classical nova nucleosynthesis, strongly influencing predicted isotopic abundance ratios in the Na-Al region. Therefore, improved nuclear physics uncertainties for this reaction rate are of critical importance for the identification and classification of pre-solar grains produced by classical novae.

Purpose: At temperatures relevant for both HBB in AGB stars and classical nova nucleosynthesis, the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate is dominated by narrow resonances, with additional contribution from direct capture. This study presents new strength values for seven resonances, as well as a study of direct capture.

Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics by impinging an intense isotopically pure beam of 22Ne onto a windowless H2 gas target. The 23Na recoils and prompt γ rays were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass separator coupled to a 4π bismuth-germanate scintillator array surrounding the target.

Results: For the low-energy resonances, located at center of mass energies of 149, 181, and 248 keV, we recover stength values of ωγ149=0.17+0.05−0.04, ωγ181=2.2±0.4, and ωγ248=8.2±0.7 μeV, respectively. These results are in broad agreement with recent studies performed by the LUNA and TUNL groups. However, for the important reference resonance at 458 keV we obtain a strength value of ωγ458=0.44±0.02 eV, which is significantly lower than recently reported values. This is the first time that this resonance has been studied completely independently from other resonance strengths. For the 632-keV resonance we recover a strength value of ωγ632=0.48±0.02 eV, which is an order of magnitude higher than a recent study. For reference resonances at 610- and 1222-keV, our strength values are in agreement with the literature. In the case of direct capture, we recover an S factor of 60 keV b, consistent with prior forward kinematics experiments.

Conclusions: In summary, we have performed the first direct measurement of 22Ne(p,γ)23Na in inverse kinematics. Our results are in broad agreement with the literature, with the notable exception of the 458-keV resonance, for which we obtain a lower strength value. We assessed the impact of the present reaction rate in reference to a variety of astrophysical environments, including AGB stars and classical novae. Production of 23Na in AGB stars is minimally influenced by the factor of 4 increase in the present rate compared to the STARLIB-2013 compilation. The present rate does however impact upon the production of nuclei in the Ne-Al region for classical novae, with dramatically improved uncertainties in the predicted isotopic abundances present in the novae ejecta.},

The 113In nucleus is such a case with several open questions regarding its origin at extreme stellar environments. In this work, the experimental study of the cross sections of the radiative proton-capture reaction 112Cd(p,γ)113In is attempted for the first time at energies lying inside the Gamow window with an isotopically enriched 112Cd target. Two different techniques, the in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy and the activation method, have been applied. The latter method is required to account for the presence of a low-lying 113In isomer at 392 keV having a halflife of $\approx$100 min. From the cross sections, the astrophysical S factors and the isomeric ratios have been additionally deduced. The experimental results are compared to detailed Hauser-Feshbach theoretical calculations using TALYS, and discussed in terms of their significance to the optical model potential involved.}

  abstract={In this Letter we report on the first inverse kinematics measurement of key resonances in the reaction which forms part of the NeNa cycle, and is relevant for 23Na synthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. An anti-correlation in O and Na abundances is seen across all well-studied globular clusters (GC), however, reaction-rate uncertainties limit the precision as to which stellar evolution models can reproduce the observed isotopic abundance patterns. Given the importance of GC observations in testing stellar evolution models and their dependence on NeNa reaction rates, it is critical that the nuclear physics uncertainties on the origin of 23Na be addressed. We present results of direct strengths measurements of four key resonances in at E = 149 keV, 181 keV, 248 keV and 458 keV. The strength of the important E = 458 keV reference resonance has been determined independently of other resonance strengths for the first time with an associated strength of ωγ = 0.439(22) eV and with higher precision than previously reported. Our result deviates from the two most recently published results obtained from normal kinematics measurements performed by the LENA and LUNA collaborations but is in agreement with earlier measurements. The impact of our rate on the Na-pocket formation in AGB stars and its relation to the O-Na anti-correlation was assessed via network calculations. Further, the effect on isotopic abundances in CO and ONe novae ejecta with respect to pre-solar grains was investigated.},

  abstract= {Background: One of the primary objectives of the field of Nuclear Astrophysics is the study of the elemental and isotopic abundances in the universe. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms behind the production of a large number of nuclides in the isotopic chart, there are still many open questions regarding a number of neutron-deficient nuclei, the p nuclei. To that end, experimentally deduced nuclear reaction cross sections can provide invaluable input to astrophysical models.

Purpose: The reactions 107,109Ag(p,γ)108,110Cd have been studied at energies inside the astrophysically relevant energy window in an attempt to provide experimental data required for the testing of reaction-rate predictions in terms of the statistical model of Hauser-Feshbach around the p nucleus 108Cd.

Methods: The experiments were performed with in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy with proton beams accelerated by the Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator at NCSR “Demokritos” impinging a target of natural silver. A set of high-purity germanium detectors was employed to record the emitted radiation.

Results: A first set of total cross-section measurements in radiative proton-capture reactions involving 107,109Ag, producing the p-nucleus 108Cd, inside the astrophysically relevant energy window is reported. The experimental results are compared to theoretical calculations, using talys. An overall good agreement between the data and the theoretical calculations has been found.

Conclusions: The results reported in this work add new information to the relatively unexplored p process. The present measurements can serve as a reference point in understanding the nuclear parameters in the related astrophysical environments and for future theoretical modeling and experimental works.},

  abstract={Measurements of nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments are considered quite important for the understanding of nuclear structure both near and far from the valley of stability. The recent advent of radioactive beams has resulted in a plethora of new, continuously flowing, experimental data on nuclear structure – including nuclear moments – which hinders the information management. A new, dedicated, public and user friendly online database (http://magneticmoments.info) has been created comprising experimental data of nuclear electromagnetic moments. The present database supersedes existing printed compilations, including also non-evaluated series of data and relevant meta-data, while putting strong emphasis on bimonthly updates. The scope, features and extensions of the database are reported.},
