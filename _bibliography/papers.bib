  abstract={   Radiative capture reactions play a pivotal role for our understanding of the origin of the elements in the cosmos. Recoil separators provide an effective way to study these reactions, in inverse kinematics, and take advantage of the use of radioactive ion beams. However, a limiting factor in the study of radiative capture reactions in inverse kinematics is the momentum spread of the product nuclei, which can result in an angular spread larger than the geometric acceptance of the separator. The DRAGON facility at TRIUMF is a versatile recoil separator, designed to study radiative capture reactions relevant to astrophysics in the A∼10−30 region. In this work we present the first attempt to study with DRAGON a reaction, 6Li(α,γ)10B, for which the recoil angular spread exceeds DRAGON's acceptance. Our result is in good agreement with the literature value, showing that DRAGON can measure resonance strengths of astrophysically important reactions even when not all the recoils enter the separator.

  abstract={Background: Globular clusters are known to exhibit anomalous abundance trends such as the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation. This trend is thought to arise via pollution of the cluster interstellar medium from a previous generation of stars. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars undergoing hot bottom burning (HBB) are a prime candidate for producing sodium-rich oxygen-poor material, and then expelling this material via strong stellar winds. The amount of 23Na produced in this environment has been shown to be sensitive to uncertainties in the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate. The 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction is also activated in classical nova nucleosynthesis, strongly influencing predicted isotopic abundance ratios in the Na-Al region. Therefore, improved nuclear physics uncertainties for this reaction rate are of critical importance for the identification and classification of pre-solar grains produced by classical novae.

Purpose: At temperatures relevant for both HBB in AGB stars and classical nova nucleosynthesis, the 22Ne(p,γ)23Na reaction rate is dominated by narrow resonances, with additional contribution from direct capture. This study presents new strength values for seven resonances, as well as a study of direct capture.

Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics by impinging an intense isotopically pure beam of 22Ne onto a windowless H2 gas target. The 23Na recoils and prompt γ rays were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass separator coupled to a 4π bismuth-germanate scintillator array surrounding the target.

Results: For the low-energy resonances, located at center of mass energies of 149, 181, and 248 keV, we recover stength values of ωγ149=0.17+0.05−0.04, ωγ181=2.2±0.4, and ωγ248=8.2±0.7 μeV, respectively. These results are in broad agreement with recent studies performed by the LUNA and TUNL groups. However, for the important reference resonance at 458 keV we obtain a strength value of ωγ458=0.44±0.02 eV, which is significantly lower than recently reported values. This is the first time that this resonance has been studied completely independently from other resonance strengths. For the 632-keV resonance we recover a strength value of ωγ632=0.48±0.02 eV, which is an order of magnitude higher than a recent study. For reference resonances at 610- and 1222-keV, our strength values are in agreement with the literature. In the case of direct capture, we recover an S factor of 60 keV b, consistent with prior forward kinematics experiments.

Conclusions: In summary, we have performed the first direct measurement of 22Ne(p,γ)23Na in inverse kinematics. Our results are in broad agreement with the literature, with the notable exception of the 458-keV resonance, for which we obtain a lower strength value. We assessed the impact of the present reaction rate in reference to a variety of astrophysical environments, including AGB stars and classical novae. Production of 23Na in AGB stars is minimally influenced by the factor of 4 increase in the present rate compared to the STARLIB-2013 compilation. The present rate does however impact upon the production of nuclei in the Ne-Al region for classical novae, with dramatically improved uncertainties in the predicted isotopic abundances present in the novae ejecta.}

  abstract={In this Letter we report on the first inverse kinematics measurement of key resonances in the reaction which forms part of the NeNa cycle, and is relevant for 23Na synthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. An anti-correlation in O and Na abundances is seen across all well-studied globular clusters (GC), however, reaction-rate uncertainties limit the precision as to which stellar evolution models can reproduce the observed isotopic abundance patterns. Given the importance of GC observations in testing stellar evolution models and their dependence on NeNa reaction rates, it is critical that the nuclear physics uncertainties on the origin of 23Na be addressed. We present results of direct strengths measurements of four key resonances in at E = 149 keV, 181 keV, 248 keV and 458 keV. The strength of the important E = 458 keV reference resonance has been determined independently of other resonance strengths for the first time with an associated strength of ωγ = 0.439(22) eV and with higher precision than previously reported. Our result deviates from the two most recently published results obtained from normal kinematics measurements performed by the LENA and LUNA collaborations but is in agreement with earlier measurements. The impact of our rate on the Na-pocket formation in AGB stars and its relation to the O-Na anti-correlation was assessed via network calculations. Further, the effect on isotopic abundances in CO and ONe novae ejecta with respect to pre-solar grains was investigated.},

  abstract= {Background: One of the primary objectives of the field of Nuclear Astrophysics is the study of the elemental and isotopic abundances in the universe. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms behind the production of a large number of nuclides in the isotopic chart, there are still many open questions regarding a number of neutron-deficient nuclei, the p nuclei. To that end, experimentally deduced nuclear reaction cross sections can provide invaluable input to astrophysical models.

Purpose: The reactions 107,109Ag(p,γ)108,110Cd have been studied at energies inside the astrophysically relevant energy window in an attempt to provide experimental data required for the testing of reaction-rate predictions in terms of the statistical model of Hauser-Feshbach around the p nucleus 108Cd.

Methods: The experiments were performed with in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy with proton beams accelerated by the Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator at NCSR “Demokritos” impinging a target of natural silver. A set of high-purity germanium detectors was employed to record the emitted radiation.

Results: A first set of total cross-section measurements in radiative proton-capture reactions involving 107,109Ag, producing the p-nucleus 108Cd, inside the astrophysically relevant energy window is reported. The experimental results are compared to theoretical calculations, using talys. An overall good agreement between the data and the theoretical calculations has been found.

Conclusions: The results reported in this work add new information to the relatively unexplored p process. The present measurements can serve as a reference point in understanding the nuclear parameters in the related astrophysical environments and for future theoretical modeling and experimental works.},

  abstract= {Reactions involving the group of nuclei commonly known as p nuclei are part of the nucleosynthetic mechanisms at astrophysical sites. The 113In nucleus is such a case with several open questions regarding its origin at extreme stellar environments. In this work, the experimental study of the cross sections of the radiative proton-capture reaction 112Cd(p,γ)113In is attempted for the first time at energies lying inside the Gamow window with an isotopically enriched 112Cd target. Two different techniques, the in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy and the activation method, have been applied. The latter method is required to account for the presence of a low-lying 113In isomer at 392 keV having a halflife of $\approx$100 min. From the cross sections, the astrophysical S factors and the isomeric ratios have been additionally deduced. The experimental results are compared to detailed Hauser-Feshbach theoretical calculations using TALYS, and discussed in terms of their significance to the optical model potential involved.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
