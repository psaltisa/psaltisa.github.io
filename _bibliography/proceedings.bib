  abstract = { Astrophysical reactions involving radioactive isotopes (RI) often
play an important role in high-temperature stellar environments. The experi-
mental studies on the reaction rates for those are still limited mainly due to the
technical difficulties in producing high-quality RI beams. A direct measure-
ment of those reactions would be still challenging in many cases, however, we
can make a reliable evaluation of the reaction rates by an indirect method or by
studying the resonance prorerties. Here we introduce recent examples of exper-
imental studies on such RI-involving astrophysical reactions, performed at Cen-
ter for Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo, using the low-energy RI beam
separator CRIB. One is for the neutron-induced destruction reactions of 7 Be in
the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis, and the other is the study on the 22Mg(α, p) reac-
tion relevant in X-ray bursts, which was performed with the resonant scattering
method from the inverse reaction channel.}

 uncertainty affecting the shape of light curves from Type I X-ray bursts. This reaction is dominated by the 4.03 MeV
 resonance in 19Ne. Previous measurements by our group have shown that this state is populated in the decay sequence of
 20Mg. A single 20Mg(βp α)15O event through the key 15O(α,γ)19Ne resonance yields a characteristic signature: the emission
 of a proton and alpha particle. To achieve the granularity necessary for the identification of this signature, we have
 upgraded the Proton Detector of the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) into a time projection chamber to
 form the GADGET II detection system. GADGET II has been fully constructed, and is entering the testing phase.},

However, experimental information is insufficient to deduce a precise 22Mg(α,p)25Al reaction rate for the respective XRB temperature range. A new measurement of 25Al+p resonant scattring was performed up to the astrophysically interested energy region of 22Mg(α,p)25Al. Several resonances were observed in the excitation functions, and their level properties have been determined based on an R-matrix analysis.
  In particular, proton widths and spin-parities of four natural-parity resonances above the α threshold of 26Si,
  which can contribute the reaction rate of 22Mg(α,p)25Al, were ﬁrst experimentally determined.},

  abstract={The production of the p–nuclei is one of the unsolved puzzles in nuclear astrophysics. A possible mechanism is the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino–driven winds of core–collapse supernovae (νp–process), but it carries uncertainties, mostly in the supernova dynamics and the nuclear physics input. The pp-chain breakout reaction 7Be(α,γ)11C, which occurs prior to the supernova explosion, was identified as an important link which can influence the nuclear flow of the z/p-process and the final abundances of the p-nuclei. Nevertheless, its reaction rate is poorly known over the relevant energy range (T=1.5-3 GK). To improve the 7Be(α,γ)11C rate for vp-process nucleosynthesis temperatures, the first measurement of the strengths of two important resonances with unknown strength was recently performed at TRIUMF. A radioactive 7Be beam (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam and the DRAGON recoil separator were used. The experimental details and preliminary results for the resonance strengths will be discussed.},

There is an order of magnitude discrepancy with the predicted and theoretical abundances of these endpoint nuclides produced in a classical nova. The uncertainty in the theoretical 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction rate has been shown to affect the abundances by an order of magnitude or more. The only direct measurement of this reaction rate was performed with the DRAGON facility at TRIUMF; however additional spectroscopic data could aid the interpretation of this data as well as motivate further study of this reaction rate.

  abstract={The γ-ray observatory has been detecting β-delayed γ-rays from 26Al for more than two decades. The half life of 26Al is 7.75 × 105 years and is sufficiently short on the scale of the galactic evolution but long enough to disperse in the interstellar medium. Hence, the abundance of this nuclide is one of the candidates to understand nucleosynthesys in massive environments such as Wolf–Rayet stars, AGB stars and supernovae. However, the abundance of 26Al in the interstellar medium from the observed flux has been inconsistent with nuclear reaction network calculations. One of the clues to solve this discrepancy is its isomer, 26mAl. Because its spin-parity is 0+, it directly decays to the ground state of 26Mg without emitting γ-rays. Despite the difference of the spin-parity between the ground state and the isomeric state, they could be under thermal equilibrium in high temperature environments, so that there is a possibility that the calculated flux sinks below the network calculations. To complement one of the destructive reactions of 26mAl, the experiment of the resonant elastic scattering of the 26mAl(p, γ) reaction with the cocktail 26g,mAl RI beam was conducted.},

The νp-process is a candidate for the production of the light p-nuclei, but it presents high sensitivity to both supernova dynamics and nuclear physics. It has been recently shown that the breakout from pp-chains through the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction, which occurs prior to νp-process, can significantly influence the reaction flow, and subsequently the production of p-nuclei in the 90<A<110 region. Nevertheless, this reaction has not been studied well yet in the relevant temperature range - T = 1.5–3 GK. To that end, the first direct study of important resonances of the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction with unknown strengths using DRAGON was recently performed at TRIUMF. The reaction was studied in inverse kinematics using a radioactive 7Be (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam provided by ISAC-I and two resonances above the 11C α-separation energy - Qα=7543.62 keV - were measured. The experimental details, in particular how the recoil transmission and BGO efficiencies were accounted for considering the large cone angle for this reaction, will be presented and discussed alongside some preliminary results.},

However, studies with radioactive isomer beams are sparse and have often required sophisticated apparatuses coupled with the technologies of ground-state beams due to typical mass differences on the order of hundreds of keV and vastly different lifetimes for isomers. We present an application of a isomeric beam of 26mAl to one of the most famous observables in nuclear astrophysics: galactic 26Al. The characteristic decay of 26Al in the Galaxy was the first such specific radioactivity to be observed originating from outside the Earth some four decades ago. We present a newly-developed, novel technique to probe the structure of low-spin states in 27Si. Using the Center for Nuclear Study low-energy radioisotope beam separator (CRIB), we report on the measurement of 26mAl proton resonant elastic scattering conducted with a thick target in inverse kinematics. The preliminary results of this on-going study are presented.},
