    there was previously only one measurement available, which present results
    agree with. New highly excited states were observed in all decay channels
    studied. Although branching ratios and the spins of the states were not
    determined, important spectroscopic information is obtained and present
    results are in good agreement with the proposed α–Xn–α molecular structure of these isotopes,

abundance distributions of heavy elements, such as europium, seen in
ultra-metal poor stars. In contrast, observations of elements 26 < Z < 47
display overabundances relative to r-process model predictions. A
proposed additional source of early nucleosynthesis is the weak r-process
in neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae. It has been shown
that in this site (α,n) reactions are both crucial to nucleosynthesis and the
main source of uncertainty in model-based abundance predictions. Aiming
to improve the certainty of nucleosynthesis predictions, the cross section of
the important reaction 86 Kr(α,n)89Sr has been measured at an energy
relevant to the weak r-process. This experiment was conducted in inverse
kinematics at TRIUMF with the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer and the

The pp-chain breakout reaction 7Be(α,γ)11C, which occurs prior to the supernova explosion, was identified as an important link which can influence the nuclear flow of the z/p-process and the final abundances of the p-nuclei. Nevertheless, its reaction rate is poorly known over the relevant energy range (T=1.5-3 GK).

The half life of 26Al is 7.75 × 105 years and is sufficiently short on the scale of the galactic evolution but long enough to disperse in the interstellar medium. Hence, the abundance of this nuclide is one of the candidates to understand nucleosynthesys in massive environments such as Wolf–Rayet stars, AGB stars and supernovae. However, the abundance of 26Al in the interstellar medium from the observed flux has been inconsistent with nuclear reaction network calculations. One of the clues to solve this discrepancy is its isomer, 26mAl. Because its spin-parity is 0+, it directly decays to the ground state of 26Mg without emitting γ-rays. Despite the difference of the spin-parity between the ground state and the isomeric state, they could be under thermal equilibrium in high temperature environments, so that there is a possibility that the calculated flux sinks below the network calculations. To complement one of the destructive reactions of 26mAl, the experiment of the resonant elastic scattering of the 26mAl(p, γ) reaction with the cocktail 26g,mAl RI beam was conducted.},

Nevertheless, this reaction has not been studied well yet in the relevant temperature range - T = 1.5–3 GK. To that end, the first direct study of important resonances of the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction with unknown strengths using DRAGON was recently performed at TRIUMF. The reaction was studied in inverse kinematics using a radioactive 7Be (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam provided by ISAC-I and two resonances above the 11C α-separation energy - Qα=7543.62 keV - were measured. The experimental details, in particular how the recoil transmission and BGO efficiencies were accounted for considering the large cone angle for this reaction, will be presented and discussed alongside some preliminary results.},

  abstract={One of the important, but still unsettled topics in Nuclear Astrophysicsis the production of thep-nuclei. Thep-process relies on an extended reactionnetwork, which can be described theoretically by the Hauser–Feshbach statisticalmodel, which in turn relies strongly on experimental data. To provide reliable dataforp-nuclei, an experimental campaign at the Tandem Accelerator Laboratory ofNCSR “Demokritos”, focusing on107,109Ag(p,γ)108,110Cd and112Cd(p,γ)113Inreaction cross-sections measurements was carried out. Both reactions were studiedusing a set of four HPGe detectors via the in-beamγ-ray spectroscopy, while for thelatter the activation method was additionally employed to account for the populationof a low-lying isomeric state. Total cross sections for proton beam energies lyinginside the Gamow window for energies relevant top-process nucleosynthesis wereobtained for the first time. Experimental results are compared to Hauser–Feshbachcalculations performed with the latest version of the TALYScode (v1.9). An overallgood agreement has been achieved. These results provide important new input forthe theoretical description of thep-process, but additionally for the origin of thecross-pointp-nucleus113In.},

  abstract={In classical novae simulations, the uncertainty in the reaction rate of 38K(p,γ) has been shown to affect the abundances of endpoint nuclides significantly. To better understand the reaction rate, we have done a spectroscopic study on 39Ca. The reaction 40Ca(d,t)39Ca at a beam energy of 22 MeV was used to populate excited states of 39Ca. Tritons were momentum analyzed using a high resolution quadrupole-dipole-dipole-dipole (Q3D) magnetic spectrograph at 4 angles. Preliminary resonance energies for 39Ca within the energetic region of interest for classical novae - 6.0–6.4 MeV - were determined.},

  abstract={Astrophysical observables that are directly linked to nuclear physics inputs provide critical and stringent constraints on nucleosynthetic models. As 26Al was the first specific radioactivity observed in the Galaxy, its origin has fascinated the nuclear astrophysics community for nearly forty years. Despite extensive research, the precise origins of 26Al remain elusive. At present, the sum of all putative stellar contributions generally overestimates the 26Al mass in the interstellar medium. Among the many reactions that influence the yield of 26Al, radiative proton capture on its isomer 26mAl is one of the least constrained reactions by experimental data. To this end, we developed a 26Al isomeric beam and performed proton elastic scattering to search for low-spin states in 27Si. The experimental method and the preliminary results of this on-going study will be presented.},

  abstract={The advent of radioactive ground-state beams some three decades ago ultimately sparked a revolution in our understanding of nuclear physics. However, studies with radioactive isomer beams are sparse and have often required sophisticated apparatuses coupled with the technologies of ground-state beams due to typical mass differences on the order of hundreds of keV and vastly different lifetimes for isomers. We present an application of a isomeric beam of 26mAl to one of the most famous observables in nuclear astrophysics: galactic 26Al. The characteristic decay of 26Al in the Galaxy was the first such specific radioactivity to be observed originating from outside the Earth some four decades ago. We present a newly-developed, novel technique to probe the structure of low-spin states in 27Si. Using the Center for Nuclear Study low-energy radioisotope beam separator (CRIB), we report on the measurement of 26mAl proton resonant elastic scattering conducted with a thick target in inverse kinematics. The preliminary results of this on-going study are presented.},
