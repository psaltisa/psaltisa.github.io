 abstract={ Sensitivity studies have shown that the 15O(α,γ)19Ne reaction is the most important reaction rate
 uncertainty affecting the shape of light curves from Type I X-ray bursts. This reaction is dominated by the 4.03 MeV
 resonance in 19Ne. Previous measurements by our group have shown that this state is populated in the decay sequence of
 20Mg. A single 20Mg(βp α)15O event through the key 15O(α,γ)19Ne resonance yields a characteristic signature: the emission
 of a proton and alpha particle. To achieve the granularity necessary for the identification of this signature, we have
 upgraded the Proton Detector of the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) into a time projection chamber to
 form the GADGET II detection system. GADGET II has been fully constructed, and is entering the testing phase.},

However, experimental information is insufficient to deduce a precise 22Mg(α,p)25Al reaction rate for the respective XRB temperature range. A new measurement of 25Al+p resonant scattring was performed up to the astrophysically interested energy region of 22Mg(α,p)25Al. Several resonances were observed in the excitation functions, and their level properties have been determined based on an R-matrix analysis.
  In particular, proton widths and spin-parities of four natural-parity resonances above the α threshold of 26Si,
  which can contribute the reaction rate of 22Mg(α,p)25Al, were ﬁrst experimentally determined.},

There is an order of magnitude discrepancy with the predicted and theoretical abundances of these endpoint nuclides produced in a classical nova. The uncertainty in the theoretical 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction rate has been shown to affect the abundances by an order of magnitude or more. The only direct measurement of this reaction rate was performed with the DRAGON facility at TRIUMF; however additional spectroscopic data could aid the interpretation of this data as well as motivate further study of this reaction rate.

A possible mechanism is the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino–driven winds of core–collapse supernovae (νp–process), but it carries uncertainties, mostly in the supernova dynamics and the nuclear physics input. The pp-chain breakout reaction 7Be(α,γ)11C, which occurs prior to the supernova explosion, was identified as an important link which can influence the nuclear flow of the z/p-process and the final abundances of the p-nuclei. Nevertheless, its reaction rate is poorly known over the relevant energy range (T=1.5-3 GK). To improve the 7Be(α,γ)11C rate for vp-process nucleosynthesis temperatures, the first measurement of the strengths of two important resonances with unknown strength was recently performed at TRIUMF. A radioactive 7Be beam (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam and the DRAGON recoil separator were used. The experimental details and preliminary results for the resonance strengths will be discussed.},

The νp-process is a candidate for the production of the light p-nuclei, but it presents high sensitivity to both supernova dynamics and nuclear physics. It has been recently shown that the breakout from pp-chains through the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction, which occurs prior to νp-process, can significantly influence the reaction flow, and subsequently the production of p-nuclei in the 90<A<110 region. Nevertheless, this reaction has not been studied well yet in the relevant temperature range - T = 1.5–3 GK. To that end, the first direct study of important resonances of the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction with unknown strengths using DRAGON was recently performed at TRIUMF. The reaction was studied in inverse kinematics using a radioactive 7Be (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam provided by ISAC-I and two resonances above the 11C α-separation energy - Qα=7543.62 keV - were measured. The experimental details, in particular how the recoil transmission and BGO efficiencies were accounted for considering the large cone angle for this reaction, will be presented and discussed alongside some preliminary results.},

  abstract={The γ-ray observatory has been detecting β-delayed γ-rays from 26Al for more than two decades. The half life of 26Al is 7.75 × 105 years and is sufficiently short on the scale of the galactic evolution but long enough to disperse in the interstellar medium. Hence, the abundance of this nuclide is one of the candidates to understand nucleosynthesys in massive environments such as Wolf–Rayet stars, AGB stars and supernovae. However, the abundance of 26Al in the interstellar medium from the observed flux has been inconsistent with nuclear reaction network calculations. One of the clues to solve this discrepancy is its isomer, 26mAl. Because its spin-parity is 0+, it directly decays to the ground state of 26Mg without emitting γ-rays. Despite the difference of the spin-parity between the ground state and the isomeric state, they could be under thermal equilibrium in high temperature environments, so that there is a possibility that the calculated flux sinks below the network calculations. To complement one of the destructive reactions of 26mAl, the experiment of the resonant elastic scattering of the 26mAl(p, γ) reaction with the cocktail 26g,mAl RI beam was conducted.},
