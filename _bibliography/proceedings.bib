  abstract={Classical novae are environments which can produce heavier elements up to mass A ~ 40. These nuclides at the endpoint of nova nucleosynthesis consist of elements such as Ar, K, and Ca. There is an order of magnitude discrepancy with the predicted and theoretical abundances of these endpoint nuclides produced in a classical nova. The uncertainty in the theoretical 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction rate has been shown to affect the abundances by an order of magnitude or more. The only direct measurement of this reaction rate was performed with the DRAGON facility at TRIUMF; however additional spectroscopic data could aid the interpretation of this data as well as motivate further study of this reaction rate. In this study, we present the preliminary results of a spectroscopic study of 39Ca using the 40Ca(d,t)39Ca reaction carried out at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratory in Garching, Germany.},

  abstract={The production of the p–nuclei is one of the unsolved puzzles in nuclear astrophysics. A possible mechanism is the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino–driven winds of core–collapse supernovae (νp–process), but it carries uncertainties, mostly in the supernova dynamics and the nuclear physics input. The pp-chain breakout reaction 7Be(α,γ)11C, which occurs prior to the supernova explosion, was identified as an important link which can influence the nuclear flow of the z/p-process and the final abundances of the p-nuclei. Nevertheless, its reaction rate is poorly known over the relevant energy range (T=1.5-3 GK). To improve the 7Be(α,γ)11C rate for vp-process nucleosynthesis temperatures, the first measurement of the strengths of two important resonances with unknown strength was recently performed at TRIUMF. A radioactive 7Be beam (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam and the DRAGON recoil separator were used. The experimental details and preliminary results for the resonance strengths will be discussed.},

  abstract={The origin of the p-nuclei, has been a long-standing puzzle in nuclear astrophysics. The νp-process is a candidate for the production of the light p-nuclei, but it presents high sensitivity to both supernova dynamics and nuclear physics. It has been recently shown that the breakout from pp-chains through the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction, which occurs prior to νp-process, can significantly influence the reaction flow, and subsequently the production of p-nuclei in the 90<A<110 region. Nevertheless, this reaction has not been studied well yet in the relevant temperature range - T = 1.5–3 GK. To that end, the first direct study of important resonances of the 7Be(α,γ)11C reaction with unknown strengths using DRAGON was recently performed at TRIUMF. The reaction was studied in inverse kinematics using a radioactive 7Be (t1/2 = 53.24 d) beam provided by ISAC-I and two resonances above the 11C α-separation energy - Qα=7543.62 keV - were measured. The experimental details, in particular how the recoil transmission and BGO efficiencies were accounted for considering the large cone angle for this reaction, will be presented and discussed alongside some preliminary results.},

  abstract={The γ-ray observatory has been detecting β-delayed γ-rays from 26Al for more than two decades. The half life of 26Al is 7.75 × 105 years and is sufficiently short on the scale of the galactic evolution but long enough to disperse in the interstellar medium. Hence, the abundance of this nuclide is one of the candidates to understand nucleosynthesys in massive environments such as Wolf–Rayet stars, AGB stars and supernovae. However, the abundance of 26Al in the interstellar medium from the observed flux has been inconsistent with nuclear reaction network calculations. One of the clues to solve this discrepancy is its isomer, 26mAl. Because its spin-parity is 0+, it directly decays to the ground state of 26Mg without emitting γ-rays. Despite the difference of the spin-parity between the ground state and the isomeric state, they could be under thermal equilibrium in high temperature environments, so that there is a possibility that the calculated flux sinks below the network calculations. To complement one of the destructive reactions of 26mAl, the experiment of the resonant elastic scattering of the 26mAl(p, γ) reaction with the cocktail 26g,mAl RI beam was conducted.},

  abstract={One of the important, but still unsettled topics in Nuclear Astrophysicsis the production of thep-nuclei. Thep-process relies on an extended reactionnetwork, which can be described theoretically by the Hauser–Feshbach statisticalmodel, which in turn relies strongly on experimental data. To provide reliable dataforp-nuclei, an experimental campaign at the Tandem Accelerator Laboratory ofNCSR “Demokritos”, focusing on107,109Ag(p,γ)108,110Cd and112Cd(p,γ)113Inreaction cross-sections measurements was carried out. Both reactions were studiedusing a set of four HPGe detectors via the in-beamγ-ray spectroscopy, while for thelatter the activation method was additionally employed to account for the populationof a low-lying isomeric state. Total cross sections for proton beam energies lyinginside the Gamow window for energies relevant top-process nucleosynthesis wereobtained for the first time. Experimental results are compared to Hauser–Feshbachcalculations performed with the latest version of theTALYScode (v1.9). An overallgood agreement has been achieved. These results provide important new input forthe theoretical description of thep-process, but additionally for the origin of thecross-pointp-nucleus113In.},

As 26Al was the first specific radioactivity observed in the Galaxy, its origin has fascinated the nuclear astrophysics community for nearly forty years. Despite extensive research, the precise origins of 26Al remain elusive. At present, the sum of all putative stellar contributions generally overestimates the 26Al mass in the interstellar medium. Among the many reactions that influence the yield of 26Al, radiative proton capture on its isomer 26mAl is one of the least constrained reactions by experimental data. To this end, we developed a 26Al isomeric beam and performed proton elastic scattering to search for low-spin states in 27Si. The experimental method and the preliminary results of this on-going study will be presented.},

  abstract={The advent of radioactive ground-state beams some three decades ago ultimately sparked a revolution in our understanding of nuclear physics. However, studies with radioactive isomer beams are sparse and have often required sophisticated apparatuses coupled with the technologies of ground-state beams due to typical mass differences on the order of hundreds of keV and vastly different lifetimes for isomers. We present an application of a isomeric beam of 26mAl to one of the most famous observables in nuclear astrophysics: galactic 26Al. The characteristic decay of 26Al in the Galaxy was the first such specific radioactivity to be observed originating from outside the Earth some four decades ago. We present a newly-developed, novel technique to probe the structure of low-spin states in 27Si. Using the Center for Nuclear Study low-energy radioisotope beam separator (CRIB), we report on the measurement of 26mAl proton resonant elastic scattering conducted with a thick target in inverse kinematics.
