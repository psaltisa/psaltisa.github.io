<p>From 2016 to 2022 I edited in one of the <a href="http://blog.feedspot.com/science_blogs/">Top 100 Science Blogs on the Web</a>,
the science news aggregator <a href="http://www.scienceseeker.org/p/about-scienceseeker.html">ScienceSeeker</a>.
Every week I picked interesting blog posts about Art, Astronomy, Physics and General Science
out of a collection of 2,300 blogs and other science news sources from around the globe.
You can find all the picks made by the editors using the hashtag
