I"g<p>In the vast and endless space,<br />
A wondrous tale we often trace.<br />
Of elements that form our race,<br />
And in the stars, they find their place.</p>

<p>Born in the heart of a star,<br />
Elements fused, a cosmic czar.<br />
In the furnace where they war,<br />
A mighty force, and then they soar.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and helium, the first two,<br />
In the star’s womb, they renew.<br />
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen too,<br />
All formed in the stars’ debut.</p>

<p>Supernovas explode, elements endowed,<br />
Scattered and bestowed, in the universe, they crowd.<br />
Iron, gold, and silver galore,<br />
All formed in the stars’ core.</p>

<p>A tale of creation, a cosmic inspiration,<br />
Of the elements, for our admiration.<br />
In the stars, their formation,<br />
A wondrous cosmic revelation.</p>

<p>Oh, the mystery of the universe,<br />
Of the stars, an endless verse.<br />
Of elements, the essence of our birth,<br />
A cosmic tale, of infinite worth.</p>
