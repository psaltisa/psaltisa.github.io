I"é<p>Last September I had the pleasure to visit South Africa for the first time to attend the
International Nuclear Physics Conference (<a href="https://inpc2022.org/">INPC</a>) in
Cape Town. I presented my <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7da7">work</a> on
nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven ejecta. The conference included an outreach
workshop, organized by Gillian Arendse from iTHEMBA, with educators from the
Cape Academy for Mathematics, Science and Technology
(<a href="http://www.camst.co.za/">CAMST</a>). My friend and collaborator Prof. Christian
Diget prepared a short lecture regarding the <a href="https://bindingblocks.org.uk/">Binding
Blocks</a> educational program for students
between 16-19 years old. Christian asked me to help him with a demonstration
of an educational game to help students understand the hot CNO cycles and
I immediately accepted. We met the educators at the CAMST and had a lovely
evening with them. In the video below, I am giving my personal views about
nuclear astrophysics, and why I followed this path of research.</p>

  <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> <i> What we do in nuclear [astro]physics,
is that we study how the different elements in the periodic table
are created. Everything that we see in our everyday life, is made [out] of
some substance, some [chemical] elements. For example, you have calcium
in your bones, you have iron in your red blood cells [and Christian
was saying that iron is very stable]. All these different elements,
with a few exceptions, like hydrogen and helium, all of this different
material that we see and make all this exotic and this beauty in
the world and the rest of the universe are created in stars. Like
the stars that we see in the night sky, they create inside their
hearts the different elements that make up ourselves. Whatâ€™s really
amazing, and one of the reasons I decided to follow this research, is
that I learned that all of us are connected, because we are made of
exactly the same material and we are coming from the same source. The material
that makes up the Solar system comes from a huge cloud, a nebula [same as the
one that Christian told us from the childrenâ€™s book] we are made of the same
substance, 4.5 billion years ago. We might live in very different places, you
are in South Africa and I am in Germany, but we are connected; not only [with]
humans, but we are also connected to the trees and the animals and the
beautiful mountains of South Africa. We are all made out of exactly the same
material. What I am doing for my research is that I am trying to understand
why some elements are more common that others. We have lots of oxygen, lots of
carbon, but we donâ€™t have not lots of gold [it would be nice to have lots of gold!].
I am using big laboratories, like iTHEMBA, to try to recreate what happens
inside stars, how stars create these different elements. And they are paying me to
do that, and to travel to nice laces like South Africa for conferences!
Pretty cool deal right?</i></p>
