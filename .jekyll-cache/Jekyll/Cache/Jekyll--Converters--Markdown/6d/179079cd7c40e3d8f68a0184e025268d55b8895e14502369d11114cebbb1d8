<p><a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon</a> is a workshop series organized by graduate students, for graduate students, focused on science communication skills.  Its goal is to empower future leaders in technical communication to share the results from research in their field to broad and diverse audiences, not just practitioners in their fields. The series started in the U.S. in 2013 and in 2018 it accepted Canadian graduate students for the first time. I was selected out of around 900 applicants to fill one of the 50 spots for the flagship workshop that year.

<p>After ComSciCon 2018, a group of the Canadian graduate students decided to make this workshop available to our peers in the North. We worked hard and organized the first ComSciCon CAN ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ which was hosted in Hamilton, ON in summer 2019.</p>
