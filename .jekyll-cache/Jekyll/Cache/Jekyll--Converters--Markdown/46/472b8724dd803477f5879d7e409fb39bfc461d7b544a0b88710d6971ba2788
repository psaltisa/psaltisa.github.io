<p>In 2015 I joined <a href="https://scico.gr/en">SciCo</a>  - abbreviation of <b>Sci</b>ence <b>Co</b>mmunication -
 the first Non Profit Science Communication Organization in Greece.
 As an ambassador, I attended training workshops on creative writing, storytelling and science communication.
 One of the projects I participated was the creation of comic strips that would enhance the interest
 about science in an informative but fun way (You can view some of them
