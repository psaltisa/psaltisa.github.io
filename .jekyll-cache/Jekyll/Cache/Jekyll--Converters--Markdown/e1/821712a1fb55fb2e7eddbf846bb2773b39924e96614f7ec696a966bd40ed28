I"V<p>Few days ago <a href="https://xkcd.com/2778">xkcd</a> posted one of my favourite sketches
that will definitely end up in a future talk (professional or outreach). In
it, the main stick character is experimenting with fusion cuisine by heating
four cups of heavy water (which is like the regular water, but with deuterons
instead of hydrogen <sup>1</sup>H.) The process of converting hydrogen into
heavier elements is what powers the stars we see in the night sky! Iron is the
endpoint of that process in the cores of the stars, since heavier elements are
mainly created by neutron captures.</p>
