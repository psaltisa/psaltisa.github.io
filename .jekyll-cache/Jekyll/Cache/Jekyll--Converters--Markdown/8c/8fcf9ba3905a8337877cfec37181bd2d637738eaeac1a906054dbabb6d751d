    <p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-four-day-workweek-reduces-stress-without-hurting-productivity/" target="\_blank">A Four-Day Workweek Reduces Stress without Hurting Productivity</a> by Jan Dönges, Sophie Bushwick</p>

    <p>There is a very active movement that supports a four-day workweek and recent
research, as discussed in this article, shows that it promotes both the
productivity and the well-being of workers. A similar reading is the book
<a href="https://www.strategy.rest/?page_id=8645">Shorter</a> by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> The kinds of results that [the researchers are] reporting are more substantial than many of those [wellness] programs. Because again, a lot of what these programs are doing are helping people tolerate the situation that they’re in rather than changing [that situation]. It’s a much more profound thing to do—to change the nature of work—than it is to help people put up with what they’ve got.</p>

    <p><a href="https://pudding.cool/2022/12/yard-sale/" target="\_blank">Why the super rich are
inevitable</a> by The Pudding</p>

    <p>A fun and interactive post with some simple capitalism math, based on the
“Yard-sale model”. I found very interesting the results of the simulations
when redistribution was included in the system.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.</p>

“Antilibrary”</a>
by Open Culture</p>

    <p>This is an article I found to justify my love for buying books at a higher
rate than I read them. The video with Umberto Eco going through his personal
library to find a book is amazing!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> The titles lining my own home remind
me that I know little to nothing about cryptography, the evolution of
feathers, Italian folklore, illicit drug use in the Third Reich, and
whatever entomophagy is.</p>
