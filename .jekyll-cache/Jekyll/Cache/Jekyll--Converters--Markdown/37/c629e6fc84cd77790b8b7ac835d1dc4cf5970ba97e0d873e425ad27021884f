    <p>This is an article based on the work by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19160-7">Carmeri et al., Nat. Commun. <strong>11</strong>, 5444 (2020)</a> regarding the use of colours in science communication. Scientists tend to get lazy when it comes to how they are presenting their results and a wrong choice of colours can distort the data. The authors have developed a set of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862">scientific colourmaps</a> which are publicly available (I will definitely give them a try in my next publication). You can learn more about this project from Fabio Crameri in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhkj_AiicmQ" target="_blank">YouTube video <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>.</p>

    <p>Humans love stories, this is how we communicate. A good story can inspire us, make us think and act. This article provides a nice outline of the structure a story should have and how one can become a more efficient storyteller.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Keep in mind that there is a point to telling your story: You‚Äôre trying to create an experience in the mind of your listeners. Providing that takeaway for your audience is your goal.</p>

    <p>Have you heard of the story of Archimedes and his ‚ÄúEureka‚Äù moment? It might happen to you too! All you have to do is to free up your unconscious to roam freely and find the solutions to your problems.</p>
