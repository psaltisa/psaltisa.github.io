I"D<p>During my visit at Michigan State University and FRIB, I gave the weekly <a href="https://wikihost.nscl.msu.edu/NuclearTheorySeminar/doku.php">FRIB Theory Seminar</a>. It was a special occasion, because it was the first in-person seminar since the beginning of the pandemic. In it, I presented my recent work on (α,n) reactions for the weak r-process (on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07136">arXiv</a>) and the next plans of that project. My goal is to combine the latest astronomical observations, state-of-the-art astrophysical modelling and nuclear physics data to constrain the production of elements between strontium and silver.</p>
