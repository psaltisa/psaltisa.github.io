I"„<p>It is this time of the year again! Looking back in all the books I have read through this year, I made a list of the five titles that I enjoyed the most. Once again, I failed to include any fiction book in my reading list, but I hope to do that next year. In the following list you will find a diverse cohort of non-fiction titles that covers topics such as Jungian archetypes, science communication and physical exercise. In case you are interested in other book recommendations, you can also check my lists for <a href="/blog/2020/favourite-books/">2020</a> and <a href="/blog/2021/favourite-books/">2021</a>. Enjoy and happy reading!</p>
