I"1<p>Last September I had the pleasure to visit South Africa for the first time to attend the
International Nuclear Physics Conference (<a href="https://inpc2022.org/">INPC</a>) in
Cape Town. I presented my <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7da7">work</a> on
nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven ejecta. The conference included an outreach
workshop, organized by Gillian Arendse from iTHEMBA, with educators from the
Cape Academy for Mathematics, Science and Technology
(<a href="http://www.camst.co.za/">CAMST</a>). My friend and collaborator Prof. Christian
Diget prepared a short lecture regarding the <a href="https://bindingblocks.org.uk/">Binding
Blocks</a> educational program for students
between 16-19 years old. Christian asked me to help him with a demonstration
of an educational game to help students understand the hot CNO cycles and
I immediately accepted. We met the educators at the CAMST and had a lovely
evening with them. In the video below, I am giving my personal views about
nuclear astrophysics, and why I followed this path of research.</p>
