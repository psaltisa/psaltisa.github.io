I"9<p>With great pleasure I accepted an invitation to join the <a href="https://nugrid.github.io/" target="\_blank">NuGrid</a> collaboration PI team. The NuGrid collaboration, formed in 2007, develops and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations with up-to-date and flexible nuclear physics input, and apply these to complete sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments.</p>

<p>You can learn more about NuGrid in the collaboration <a href="https://nugrid.github.io/content/manifesto" target="\_blank">manifesto</a>. My involvement with NuGrid dates back to my third year as a Ph.D. student, when I joined the collaboration to work on a project related to ŒΩp-process nucleosynthesis.</p>

<p>I am really excited about all the future projects I will work on along with my collaborators in NuGrid üòÅ</p>
