<p>Last year, due to the ongoing pandemic, I was thinking of picking up a hobby - preferably an outdoorsy one - to keep me active during the winter. Running was the obvious choice, since I‚Äôve been practicing consistently for many years with an exception of a 2-year-slump during my Ph.D., but I also wanted something to keep my mind sharp and strengthen my visual skills and pattern recognition. One day during the Christmas holidays, I was on a walk with a good friend of mine (also a nuclear physicist) that has been in Darmstadt for many years and he pointed towards a parked car‚Äôs number plate saying: ‚ÄúHey, this is chlorine!‚Äù</p>

<p>Vehicle number plates in Germany have a very distinct pattern, which allows to get letter combinations that correspond to elements in the periodic table. Below you can see the components of a typical number plate.</p>

<p>For example, the plate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DA FE 8970</code> would be a plate from Darmstadt (DA) where iron (Fe) is shown, and all plates from Frankfurt that start with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> show fluorine! My friend told me that some colleagues of his had found almost all elements in car plates within Darmstadt. I thought that this would be a fun project for the winter/spring, to find and take a picture of all 118 (until now) elements in the periodic table.</p>

<h3 id="the-hunt-is-on">The hunt is on!</h3>

<p>The beginning of the <em>‚Äògotta catch‚Äôem all‚Äô</em> with car plates was extremely easy, and with couple of long walks I was able to gather the first 30-40 pictures. As you might imagine, at some point, finding undiscovered elements/plates was quite cumbersome, with a discovery rate of around 1-2 per week. Finally, after three months, I was able to find my last missing element (zinc) and complete the periodic table! To be honest, I was keep looking at car plates for a long time after I finished this project - maybe I still do sometimes ü§≠.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-collage">Making the collage</h3>

<p>Before making the collage, I had to blur the rest of the plate to protect the privacy of the car owners. Then, I just had to decide how to make the collage. I ended up with a simple format, but I might come up with alternatives in the future for nuclear car 2.0.</p>
