We had an early celebration of the International Star Wars Day - May the Fourth - at the Fullsteam Brewery in Durham during this month's [Astronomy on Tap Triangle](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/durham-nc/). I gave an outreach talk about the science of Star Wars, based on my [planetarium show]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach/planetarium/).

### Star Wars: The Science Awakens

Let‚Äôs embark on a cosmic journey through the science of Star Wars over a pint of beer at Fullsteam Brewery! Join us for an evening of wonder and exploration as we explore the possibility of lightsabers, Tatooine-like planets, and navigating asteroid fields. From the speed of the Millennium Falcon to the creation of robots like R2-D2 and C-3PO, let your imagination soar as we delve into the realms of science fiction and reality.
