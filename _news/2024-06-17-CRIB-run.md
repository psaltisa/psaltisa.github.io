I just return from a month in Japan, where I led experiment at the [CRIB](https://www.cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/crib/crib-new/home-en/) facility at RIBF. Before the main experiment, we helped our local collaborators with a Machine Study to produce a radioactive beam of carbon-15. The main experiment, 13N(Î±,p), was a success: we produced a nitrogen-13 beam with an intensity of ~8e4 pps and 90% purity! We collected a lot of data for both the 13N(Î±,p) reaction and alpha elastic scattering.

We faced some challenges, including a two-day delay due to a broken valve, but we managed to gain an extra day of beamtime. The hard work and dedication of our collaborators from five different countries were crucial to this success. I eagerly await the final results of this study and look forward to returning to CRIB soon!
