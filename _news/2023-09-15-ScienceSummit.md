I was honored to participate in the Science Summit during the 78th United Nations General
Assembly held in New York. On September 15 I was part of a panel
discussion, representing the International Research Network for Astrophysics
[IReNA](https://irenaweb.org/), alongside Hendrik Schatz from Michigan State
University and Raphael Hirschi from University of Keele. Our discussion
centered on the pivotal role of international networking in advancing
scientific knowledge and addressing global challenges. The event, joinly organized by
Kata Alfoldi from the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)
and Kara Hoover from the National Science Foundation (NSF), offered a unique
opportunity to delve into the significance of international networking in expanding scientific frontiers.

Throughout the panel discussion, we explored how collaborative efforts on a global scale
can catalyze groundbreaking research. We emphasized that scientific progress
knows no boundaries, and by connecting with researchers worldwide, we can
leverage diverse perspectives, expertise, and resources to push the boundaries of what is possible.

In today's interconnected world, the importance of international cooperation
in science cannot be overstated. The challenges we face, from climate change
to healthcare innovation, require a unified, global approach. By breaking down
silos and fostering partnerships across borders, we can pool our collective
knowledge and resources to develop innovative solutions.

The panel discussion also highlighted the incredible initiatives undertaken by COST to
promote international cooperation in science. I was particularly inspired by
[COST's efforts](https://www.cost.eu/international-cooperation-nsf/) to
facilitate collaboration between European researchers and international
partners, bridging gaps and fostering a truly global scientific community.

As an early carreer researcher, I discussed how participation in research networks
can been beneficial for my development of one's career. From my experienc with 
IReNA, I described how, along with other young researchers, organized an
[online seminar
series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPuNO7inQVQLJ4GlwEdyHpcoc0U_aNRoI)
during the pandemic and an [online
workshop](https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/46/) that brought together experts in nuclear astrophysics.

My participation in the Science Summit at the 78th UN General Assembly was a
remarkable experience that reinforced the critical importance of international
networking in science. It was an opportunity to not only share our insights
but also to learn from others who are equally dedicated to advancing
scientific knowledge for the betterment of our world. As we move forward, I am
more committed than ever to championing global cooperation in science and
harnessing its potential to shape a brighter and more sustainable future for all.
