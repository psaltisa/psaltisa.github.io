With great pleasure I accepted an invitation to join the [NuGrid](https://nugrid.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} collaboration PI team. The NuGrid collaboration, formed in 2007, develops and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations with up-to-date and flexible nuclear physics input, and apply these to complete sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments.

You can learn more about NuGrid in the collaboration [manifesto](https://nugrid.github.io/content/manifesto){:target="\_blank"}. My involvement with NuGrid dates back to my third year as a Ph.D. student, when I joined the collaboration to work on a project related to ŒΩp-process nucleosynthesis.

I am really excited about all the future projects I will work on along with my collaborators in NuGrid üòÅ
