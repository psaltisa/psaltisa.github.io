I had a great time visiting Girona in Catalonia to participate in this year's [Nuclei in the Cosmos XVIII](https://indico.icc.ub.edu/event/341/){:target="\_blank"} conference. I gave a talk about my recent paper on low-metallicity nova explosions and presented a poster about the 13N(α,p)16O experiment with CRIB.

I enjoyed catching up with old friends and meeting new people thoughout the week. Thank you to my collaborator [Jordi José](http://www.fen.upc.edu/users/jjose/) for organizing such a successful and engaging conference!
