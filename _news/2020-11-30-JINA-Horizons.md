I was asked to join the Twitter ambassador team for the [JINA Horizons](https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/39/){:target="\_blank"}, a virtual meeting
of the international nuclear astrophysics community to discuss open questions and future directions. The meeting was a great success with lost of
stimulating discussions, a showcase of current research in different subfields (stellar modeling, nuclear reactions, stardust etc.) and questions about the future. One of the highlights of the meeting was [Gather Town](https://gather.town/){:target="\_blank"}, an online platform to emulate the conference 
environment using 8-bit characters. It was great to (virtually) meet friends and colleagues again and I hope that we will soon have in-person meetings/workshops.
