Recent experimental results from on-going collaborations using the [EMMA](https://fiveyearplan.triumf.ca/teams-tools/emma-electromagnetic-mass-analyzer/) and [IRIS](https://fiveyearplan.triumf.ca/teams-tools/iris-isac-charged-particle-reaction-spectroscopy-station/) facilities at [TRIUMF](https://triumf.ca) and [CRIB](https://www.cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/crib/crib-new/home-en/) at [CNS-RIBF](https://www.nishina.riken.jp/ribf/){:target="\blank"} were recently published in high-impact journals and featured in the media.

In the first experiment, we studied for the first time a nuclear reaction that is thought to occur during supernova explosions and can create some very rare isotopes called the p-nuclei.
In the second experiment, we explored the structure of one of the most neutron-rich nucleus that can be made on Earth (until now). For the last one, we studied a nuclear reaction that occurs during a specific type of stellar explosions, called X-ray bursts, in which material from a companion star is into a neutron star. The experimental results, when combined with state-of-the-art simulations and observations agree very well!
