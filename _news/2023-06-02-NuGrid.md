During the last week of May, I hosted the annual [NuGrid](https://nugrid.github.io/) collaboration
meeting at [TUNL](https://tunl.duke.edu). We had five days full of discussions
about the current and future projects of the collaboration. The meeting was
hybrid, and we are greatful to [IReNA](https://irenaweb.org)
for supporting the travel of some of our european collaborators. For the last day
of the meeting, we organized a half-day workshop with
experimental and theoretical nuclear astrophysics talks, that are related to
NuGrid and TUNL activities. You can find the schedule below:
