I had a lovely time at the [Winter Nuclear and Particle Physics Conference](Winter Nuclear and Particle Physics Conference) in Banff.
I was invited as a new Canadian nuclear physics faculty to give a talk regarding my research on γ-rays from long-lived radionuclides and  
core collapse supernovae.
The conference had a great lineup of invited talks, and both the student presentations and posters were of very high quality.
I really enjoyed meeting with old friends and making new connections with the Canadian subatomic physics community.
It was also the first time I was celebrating my birthday in a conference setting!
Big thank you to Heather Russell (UVic), Alain Bellerive (Carleton) and the rest of the organizing committee for such an engaging meeting!😊
