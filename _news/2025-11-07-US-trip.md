I came back from a short (but action-filled) research trip in the US, first time as an Assistant Prof. at SMU.
My first stop was East Lansing, MI and [FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu) for an experiment using the MUSIC detector led by my collaborators
Wei Jia Ong and Melina Avila.
I had time to catch up with some friends and collaborators, and I'll be back next April to give the FRIB/MSU Nuclear Science colloquium.

After that I headed west to California and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, where I participated in the
*"The R-Process Alliance: abundances of 2000 metal-poor stars"* [meeting](https://sites.google.com/view/rprocessalliance/meetings).
I was invited to give a talk regarding my work in neutrino-driven winds and the abundances of metal-poor stars.
The meeting was extremely interesting and I really enjoyed interacting with the observing community.
Thanks to [IReNA](https://irenaweb.org) for supporting the second leg of the trip!🙏
